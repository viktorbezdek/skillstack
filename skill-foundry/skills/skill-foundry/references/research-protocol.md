# Research Protocol for Skill Creation

Structured approach to researching domains before building skills, ensuring accuracy, currency, and evidence-based content.

---

## Core Principle

**Bad skills are worse than no skills.** They perpetuate errors, waste tokens, and damage trust.

Every skill MUST be:
- ✅ Based on official documentation
- ✅ Tested in real environments
- ✅ Using current package versions
- ✅ Preventing known, verified errors
- ✅ Documented with evidence

---

## When to Research

### Always Research (New Domain)
- Building skill for unfamiliar technology
- First skill in a technology category
- Major version change (v3 → v4)
- No working examples available

### Can Skip Research (Known Domain)
- Domain expert (use it daily)
- Already built working examples
- Minor version updates (patch/minor)
- Similar to existing skill

**Time Investment**: 1-3 hours for new domain, 15-30 min for known domain

---

## Pre-Build Research Checklist

Complete this BEFORE writing skill files:

### Step 1: Identify Official Sources (30 min)

**Find Primary Documentation**:
- [ ] Official docs website
- [ ] Official GitHub repository
- [ ] API documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Package documentation (npm, PyPI, etc.)

**Verify Documentation Quality**:
- [ ] Last updated within 1 year
- [ ] Examples work when tested
- [ ] Version information present
- [ ] No conflicting information

**Use Available Tools**:
- [ ] Check Context7 MCP for library docs (if applicable)
- [ ] Use WebFetch for official docs
- [ ] Search GitHub for official repos
- [ ] Verify npm/PyPI package exists

**Document Sources**:
```markdown
## Official Sources
1. **Primary Docs**: https://...
   - Version: X.Y.Z
   - Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
2. **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/...
   - Stars: XXX
   - Last Commit: YYYY-MM-DD
3. **Package**: npm/pypi package name
   - Current Version: X.Y.Z
```

### Step 2: Verify Package Versions (15 min)

**Check Latest Versions**:
```bash
# For npm packages
npm view <package-name> version
npm view <package-name> versions --json | tail -20

# For Python packages
pip index versions <package-name>
```

**Document Versions**:
- [ ] Latest stable version identified
- [ ] Breaking changes reviewed
- [ ] Deprecation warnings noted
- [ ] Migration guides read (if major version change)

**Version Documentation Template**:
```markdown
## Package Versions

| Package | Current | Tested | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| main-package | 4.0.0 | 4.0.0 | ✅ Stable | Latest |
| peer-dep-1 | 2.5.0 | 2.5.0 | ✅ Stable | No breaking changes |
| peer-dep-2 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | ⚠️ Beta | Check for updates |

**Last Verified**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Step 3: Research Known Issues (30 min)

**Search GitHub Issues**:
- [ ] Search: `"<package-name> error"` (recent, open)
- [ ] Search: `"<package-name> doesn't work"` (recent, closed)
- [ ] Filter: High engagement (comments, reactions)
- [ ] Note: Common error patterns

**Check Community Discussions**:
- [ ] Official Discord/Slack
- [ ] Stack Overflow top questions
- [ ] Reddit r/<technology> posts
- [ ] Twitter/X for recent complaints

**Document Errors**:
```markdown

---

## Summary Checklist

Before moving to next step (Create Test Evaluations):

- [ ] Official sources identified and reviewed
- [ ] Package versions verified and documented
- [ ] Known issues researched and documented (3+)
- [ ] Working example built and tested
- [ ] All errors encountered documented with fixes
- [ ] Sources cross-referenced for consistency
- [ ] Research log created and complete
- [ ] Quality assessment shows skill is viable
- [ ] No blocking red flags (or addressed)
- [ ] Sign-off complete

**If all checked**: Proceed to Step 1.1 (Create Test Evaluations)

**If any unchecked**: Complete research before proceeding

---

## After Research: Next Steps

✅ **Research phase complete when you have:**
- [ ] Research log in `planning/research-logs/<skill-name>.md`
- [ ] Working example built and tested
- [ ] ≥3 documented patterns/lessons from GitHub analysis
- [ ] Package versions verified current
- [ ] Known errors documented with GitHub issue links

---

### Transition to Build Phase

**Now proceed in this exact order:**

#### Step 1: Initialize Skill Structure (2 minutes)

```bash
# Create skill directory with template
python /path/to/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> \
  --path . \
  --template skill-skeleton \
  --auto-fill \
  --create-research-log
```

**Output**: Skill directory with SKILL.md, README.md, template structure

---

#### Step 2: Create Evaluations - EDD (15-30 minutes)

**Before filling any TODOs**, create test scenarios.

See **[evaluation_driven_development.md](evaluation_driven_development.md)** for complete process.

**Quick summary**:
1. Test Claude WITHOUT the skill (baseline)
2. Document struggles and gaps
3. Create 3-5 realistic scenarios
4. Define success criteria
5. Identify what docs to write

**Output**:
- Gap analysis (what information is missing?)
- Test scenarios (how to verify skill works?)
- Priority list (what to document first?)

---

#### Step 3: Fill Template Based on Gaps (20-60 minutes)

Now use your research findings and evaluation gaps to fill SKILL.md:

**Your research findings go into these sections:**

| Research Output | SKILL.md Section | Example |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Known errors from GitHub | "Known Issues Prevention" | Issue #123: Missing API key |
| Patterns from repo analysis | "Common Patterns" | Authentication pattern |
| Working example steps | "Quick Start" | 1. Install, 2. Configure, 3. Run |
| Error messages encountered | README "Known Issues Prevented" | "Missing secret key" |
| Package versions | SKILL.md frontmatter | "Latest Versions: pkg@1.2.3" |

**Your evaluation gaps guide what to write:**
- Gap: "Claude didn't know about X" → Add X to SKILL.md
- Gap: "Claude asked about Y" → Add Y to Quick Start
- Gap: "Claude made error Z" → Add Z to Critical Rules

---

#### Visual Workflow

```
Research Phase Complete
         ↓
   [Initialize]
    init_skill.py → Creates template with [TODO:] markers
         ↓
   [Evaluate - EDD]
    Test without skill → Identify gaps → Create scenarios
         ↓
   [Fill Template]
    Use gaps to guide what to write → Fill [TODO:] markers
         ↓
   [Validate]
    validate_skill.py → Fix issues → Test discovery
         ↓
   [Package]
    DONE ✅
```

---

**Next:** See [evaluation_driven_development.md](evaluation_driven_development.md) for detailed EDD process.
