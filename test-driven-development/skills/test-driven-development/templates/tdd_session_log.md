## TDD Cycles

### Cycle 1: [Brief description]

**RED - Write Failing Test**

```
Test: test_[descriptive_name]
File: [test_file.py:line_number]
Status: FAIL
```

**Test Code:**
```python
def test_descriptive_name():
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange

    # Act

    # Assert
```

**Failure Message:**
```
[Exact failure output from test runner]
```

**Time:** [HH:MM]

---

**GREEN - Make It Pass**

```
Implementation: [function/class/method]
File: [source_file.py:line_number]
Status: PASS
```

**Implementation Code:**
```python
def function_name():
    """Implementation."""
    # Minimal code to pass test
```

**All Tests Passing:** Yes / No

**Time:** [HH:MM]

---

**REFACTOR - Improve Code**

**Changes Made:**
- [ ] Improved naming
- [ ] Extracted function
- [ ] Removed duplication
- [ ] Simplified logic
- [ ] Added documentation
- [ ] No refactoring needed

**Refactoring Details:**
```
[Describe what you refactored and why]
```

**All Tests Still Passing:** Yes / No

**Commit:** `[commit hash or message]`

**Time:** [HH:MM]

---

### Cycle 2: [Brief description]

**RED - Write Failing Test**

```
Test: test_[descriptive_name]
File: [test_file.py:line_number]
Status: FAIL
```

**Test Code:**
```python
def test_descriptive_name():
    """Test description."""
    # Test code here
```

**Failure Message:**
```
[Exact failure output]
```

**Time:** [HH:MM]

---

**GREEN - Make It Pass**

```
Implementation: [function/class/method]
File: [source_file.py:line_number]
Status: PASS
```

**Implementation Code:**
```python
# Implementation here
```

**All Tests Passing:** Yes / No

**Time:** [HH:MM]

---

**REFACTOR - Improve Code**

**Changes Made:**
```
[Refactoring details]
```

**All Tests Still Passing:** Yes / No

**Commit:** `[commit hash or message]`

**Time:** [HH:MM]

```

### TDD Discipline

- [ ] Ran tests frequently

**Deviations from TDD:**
```
[Note any times you deviated and why]
