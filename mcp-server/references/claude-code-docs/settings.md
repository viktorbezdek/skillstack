# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  * `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  * `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
* For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise
  managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project
  settings. System administrators can deploy policies to:
  * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
  * Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
  * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`
* Enterprise deployments can also configure **managed MCP servers** that override
  user-configured servers. See [Enterprise MCP configuration](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#enterprise-mcp-configuration):
  * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json`
  * Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json`
  * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json`

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

Settings are applied in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **Enterprise managed policies** (`managed-settings.json`)
   * Deployed by IT/DevOps
   * Cannot be overridden

2. **Command line arguments**
   * Temporary overrides for a specific session

3. **Local project settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
   * Personal project-specific settings

4. **Shared project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)
   * Team-shared project settings in source control

5. **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
   * Personal global settings

This hierarchy ensures that enterprise security policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience.

### Key points about the configuration system

* **Memory files (CLAUDE.md)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
* **Settings files (JSON)**: Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
* **Slash commands**: Custom commands that can be invoked during a session with `/command-name`
* **MCP servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations
* **Precedence**: Higher-level configurations (Enterprise) override lower-level ones (User/Project)
* **Inheritance**: Settings are merged, with more specific settings adding to or overriding broader ones

### System prompt availability

<Note>
  Unlike for claude.ai, we do not publish Claude Code's internal system prompt on this website. Use CLAUDE.md files or `--append-system-prompt` to add custom instructions to Claude Code's behavior.
</Note>

### Excluding sensitive files

To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets, environment files), use the `permissions.deny` setting in your `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)",
      "Read(./build)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This replaces the deprecated `ignorePatterns` configuration. Files matching these patterns will be completely invisible to Claude Code, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Subagent configuration

Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

* **User subagents**: `~/.claude/agents/` - Available across all your projects
* **Project subagents**: `.claude/agents/` - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team

Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the [subagents documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents).

## Plugin configuration

Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels.

### Plugin settings

Plugin-related settings in `settings.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "formatter@company-tools": true,
    "deployer@company-tools": true,
    "analyzer@security-plugins": false
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "company-tools": {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "company/claude-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `enabledPlugins`

Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: `"plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false`

**Scopes**:

* **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal plugin preferences
* **Project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Project-specific plugins shared with team
* **Local settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Per-machine overrides (not committed)

**Example**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

#### `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources.

**When a repository includes `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

1. Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder
2. Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace
3. Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings)
4. Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent

**Example**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "company-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "company-org/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.company.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Marketplace source types**:

* `github`: GitHub repository (uses `repo`)
* `git`: Any git URL (uses `url`)
* `directory`: Local filesystem path (uses `path`, for development only)

### Managing plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins interactively:

* Browse available plugins from marketplaces
* Install/uninstall plugins
* Enable/disable plugins
* View plugin details (commands, agents, hooks provided)
* Add/remove marketplaces

Learn more about the plugin system in the [plugins documentation](/en/docs/claude-code/plugins).

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

## Tools available to Claude

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](/en/docs/claude-code/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).

### Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide).

For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.
