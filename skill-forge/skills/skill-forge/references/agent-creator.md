- Tool whitelisting and path scoping
- Capability-based role assignment
- Automatic identity generation

**Agent Design Patterns**:
- Domain specialist agents (researcher, coder, analyst, optimizer, coordinator)
- Multi-agent coordination topologies (hierarchical, mesh, ring, star)
- Evidence-based prompting (chain-of-thought, self-consistency, plan-and-solve)
- Role specialization with cognitive patterns

**Prompt Engineering Techniques**:
- Self-consistency for reliability
- Program-of-thought for structured reasoning
- Plan-and-solve decomposition

## Evidence-Based Prompting Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
**When**: Complex reasoning, multi-step analysis
**Pattern**:
```
Let's approach this systematically:
1. First, analyze [aspect 1]
2. Then, consider [aspect 2]
3. Finally, synthesize [conclusion]
```

### 2. Self-Consistency
**When**: Reliability is critical
**Pattern**:
```
Generate multiple reasoning paths:
- Path 1: [approach A]
- Path 2: [approach B]
- Path 3: [approach C]
Consensus: [most consistent answer]
```

### 3. Plan-and-Solve
**When**: Systematic task execution
**Pattern**:
```
Planning Phase:
- Break down into steps
- Identify dependencies
- Allocate resources

Solving Phase:
- Execute step-by-step
- Validate each step
- Integrate results
```

### 4. Program-of-Thought
**When**: Structured computation
**Pattern**:
```
Define variables and logic:
- Input: [parameters]
- Process: [algorithm]
- Output: [result]
Execute with verification at each step
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Coordination
```yaml
Flow: Research → Design → Implement → Test → Review
Each agent completes before next starts
Memory: Pass context via swarm/[workflow]/[step]
```

### Parallel Coordination
```yaml
Flow: All agents start simultaneously
Topology: Mesh (full communication)
Memory: Shared namespace swarm/[project]/shared
Sync: Regular coordination checkpoints
```

### Hierarchical Coordination
```yaml
Structure: Coordinator → Specialists
Coordinator: Task delegation and integration
Specialists: Domain-specific execution
Memory: Coordinator reads all, specialists write to own namespace
```

## Domain Specialization Examples

### Research Agent
```yaml
Domain: Information gathering and analysis
Cognitive Pattern: Divergent thinking + Critical analysis
Techniques: Self-consistency, Few-shot learning
Coordination: Produces research reports for downstream agents
```

### Coder Agent
```yaml
Domain: Software implementation
Cognitive Pattern: Convergent thinking + Systems thinking
Techniques: Plan-and-solve, Program-of-thought
Coordination: Reads specs, writes code, updates memory
```

### Analyst Agent
```yaml
Domain: Data analysis and insights
Cognitive Pattern: Critical thinking + Pattern recognition
Techniques: Chain-of-thought, Self-consistency
Coordination: Analyzes data, produces reports, flags anomalies
```

### Optimizer Agent
```yaml
Domain: Performance and efficiency improvement
Cognitive Pattern: Systems thinking + Creative problem-solving
Techniques: Multi-path reasoning, Constraint satisfaction
Coordination: Reviews outputs, suggests improvements
```

### Coordinator Agent
```yaml
Domain: Workflow orchestration
Cognitive Pattern: Strategic thinking + Resource allocation
Techniques: Planning, Dependency management
Coordination: Manages agent spawning and task delegation
```

## Multi-Agent System Design

### Topology Selection

**Mesh** (Full Communication):
- Use when: All agents need complete context
- Coordination: Every agent reads/writes shared memory
- Complexity: O(n²) communication overhead
- Example: Code review swarm

**Hierarchical** (Tree Structure):
- Use when: Clear delegation hierarchy exists
- Coordination: Top-down task distribution
- Complexity: O(log n) communication paths
- Example: Feature development pipeline

**Ring** (Sequential Processing):
- Use when: Linear workflow with handoffs
- Coordination: Agent N → Agent N+1
- Complexity: O(n) single path
- Example: CI/CD pipeline

**Star** (Centralized Hub):
- Use when: One coordinator manages specialists
- Coordination: Hub distributes and aggregates
- Complexity: O(n) hub-and-spoke
- Example: Project management

### Memory Management

**Namespace Strategy**:
```
swarm/
  [workflow-id]/
    coordinator/
      plan.md
      progress.json
    research/
      findings.md
      sources.json
    implementation/
      decisions.md
      code-refs.json
    shared/
      context.md
      timeline.json
```

**Memory Operations**:
```bash
# Write to memory
npx claude-flow hooks post-edit \
  --memory-key "swarm/api-dev/research/patterns" \
  --content "[findings]"

# Read from memory
npx claude-flow memory get \
  --key "swarm/api-dev/coordinator/plan"

# Query memory
npx claude-flow memory query \
  --pattern "swarm/api-dev/*/decisions"
```

## Agent Reality Map Identity Generation

**Complete Guide**: See `agent-identity-generation-guide.md` for detailed process

**Quick Reference**:
1. Generate UUID: `crypto.randomUUID()`
2. Map capabilities to role using `agent-capability-matrix.json`
3. Assign RBAC permissions from `agent-rbac-rules.json`
4. Set budget based on role (see guide)
5. Add metadata (category, specialist, tags)

**Example Identity Block**:
```yaml
identity:
  agent_id: "62af40bf-feed-4249-9e71-759b938f530c"
  role: "backend"
  role_confidence: 0.85

rbac:
  allowed_tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task, TodoWrite]
  path_scopes: ["backend/**", "api/**", "src/**", "tests/**"]
  api_access: ["github", "memory-mcp"]

budget:
  max_tokens_per_session: 200000
  max_cost_per_day: 30
  currency: "USD"

metadata:
  category: "specialists"
  specialist: true
  version: "1.0.0"

2. **Few-Shot Examples**: Use sparingly but effectively
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Embed only essential information
4. **Coordination Overhead**: Minimize unnecessary communication
5. **Caching Strategy**: Reuse context when possible

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research-Design-Implement
```yaml
Agents: Researcher → Architect → Coder
Memory Flow:
  - Researcher writes to swarm/project/research/
  - Architect reads research, writes to swarm/project/architecture/
  - Coder reads both, writes to swarm/project/implementation/
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution with Synthesis
```yaml
Agents: Multiple specialists + Coordinator
Execution:
  - All specialists work in parallel
  - Each writes to swarm/project/[specialist]/
  - Coordinator reads all, synthesizes to swarm/project/final/
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
```yaml
Agents: Implementer ↔ Reviewer
Loop:
  - Implementer creates, writes to swarm/project/draft-N/
  - Reviewer analyzes, writes feedback to swarm/project/review-N/
  - Implementer refines based on feedback
  - Repeat until quality threshold met
```

## Validation and Testing

### Unit Testing (Single Agent)
```yaml
Test: Can agent perform core task?
Input: Representative task example
Expected: Correct output format and quality
Measure: Accuracy, completeness, adherence to constraints
```

### Integration Testing (Multi-Agent)
```yaml
Test: Do agents coordinate effectively?
Input: End-to-end workflow
Expected: Successful handoffs, proper memory usage
Measure: Coordination overhead, error rate, output quality
```

### Performance Testing
```yaml
Test: Does agent scale?
Input: Increasing task complexity/volume
Expected: Consistent quality, reasonable resource usage
Measure: Token efficiency, time to completion, quality degradation
```

## Troubleshooting

**Agent Not Following Instructions**:
- Strengthen role definition and constraints
- Add more specific examples
- Use self-consistency to improve reliability

**Poor Coordination**:
- Clarify memory namespace strategy
- Add explicit synchronization points
- Simplify coordination protocol

**Inconsistent Output**:
- Apply self-consistency technique
- Add output format validation
- Provide more few-shot examples

**Performance Issues**:
- Reduce prompt length
- Optimize memory operations
- Parallelize independent tasks

## Advanced Topics

### Adaptive Agent Behavior
Use ReasoningBank patterns to allow agents to learn from experience:
```bash
# Store successful patterns
npx claude-flow memory store \
  --key "swarm/patterns/success/[scenario]" \
  --content "[what worked]"

# Retrieve for future tasks
npx claude-flow memory query \
  --pattern "swarm/patterns/success/*"
```

### Neural Pattern Training
Train agents on successful workflows:
```bash
npx claude-flow hooks neural-train \
  --pattern "[successful-workflow]" \
  --agent-type "[agent-role]"
```

### Dynamic Agent Spawning
Let coordinator spawn specialists as needed:
```bash
npx claude-flow agent-spawn \
  --type "[specialist-type]" \
  --task "[specific-task]" \
  --memory-namespace "swarm/[workflow]/[agent]"
```

## Success Metrics

**Agent Quality**:
- Task completion accuracy: >95%
