## Azure cost data foundation

### Azure Cost Management exports

Azure Cost Management is the native cost visibility tool. For serious FinOps
implementations, configure scheduled exports to Azure Storage for downstream processing.

**Export types:**
- **Actual cost** - charges as they appear on the invoice (use for billing reconciliation)
- **Amortized cost** - reservation and savings plan charges spread across the usage period
  (use for team-level showback and allocation)

**Export setup checklist:**
- [ ] Configure exports at the appropriate billing scope (Management Group for org-wide view)
- [ ] Select both actual and amortized cost exports
- [ ] Set daily granularity
- [ ] Export to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for Power BI integration
- [ ] Consider FinOps Hubs (Microsoft FinOps Toolkit) for automated ingestion and normalization

### Retail Prices API for validation

Use the Azure Retail Prices API to verify EA discounts against public pricing. Useful for:
- Comparing PAYG vs Reserved Instance pricing with ROI calculation
- Evaluating Spot VM savings potential (60-90% off PAYG)
- Estimating database and storage tier costs across regions
- Validating that EA discount percentages match contracts

### FinOps Toolkit and FinOps Hubs

Microsoft's open-source FinOps Toolkit provides pre-built solutions including Power BI
report templates, Azure Workbooks, and FinOps Hubs for automated cost data ingestion.

**FinOps Hubs** normalize cost exports into a consistent schema and feed Power BI reports.
Recommended for organizations that want production-grade reporting without building custom
data pipelines.

### Azure Resource Graph for cost analysis

Azure Resource Graph (ARG) enables large-scale resource inventory and compliance analysis
with KQL queries. Use it for:
- VM analysis by family, OS disk type, hybrid benefit status
- Storage disk type summary (Premium, Standard SSD, Standard HDD, Ultra)
- Tagging compliance analysis with percentages
- Resource distribution by business unit/owner

## Commitment discounts

### Compute commitment instruments

Azure provides four distinct instruments for reducing compute costs, plus Azure Hybrid
Benefit which acts as a licensing overlay. As with AWS, these instruments are designed
to be layered, not chosen in isolation.

**Instrument comparison:**

| Instrument | Discount depth | Flexibility | Commitment type | Term | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Azure Reservation | Up to 72% | Lowest - locked to VM family, region, size | Capacity-based (specific SKU) | 1yr or 3yr | VMs, Dedicated Hosts, App Service (Isolated), specific services |
| Azure Savings Plan for Compute | Up to 65% | High - any VM family, region, size | Spend-based ($/hr) | 1yr or 3yr | VMs, Dedicated Hosts, Container Instances, App Service (Premium v3 / Isolated v2) |
| Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) | Up to 40% (Windows), 55% (SQL) | Highest - no commitment, no lock-in | Licensing overlay | None | VMs, SQL Database, SQL MI, Red Hat/SUSE Linux |
| Spot Virtual Machines | Up to 90% | Variable - can be evicted with 30s notice | None (market-priced) | None | VMs, VMSS, AKS node pools |

**Critical distinctions:**

1. **Azure Hybrid Benefit is not a commitment - it is free money.** If you have Windows
   Server or SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance, AHB eliminates the license
   component from VM pricing. No contract, no lock-in, no restart needed. This should
   be enabled on all eligible VMs before any other commitment decision. Windows licence
   costs can account for 44% of a Windows VM price (e.g. D4_v5 Windows at ~0.35/hr =
   ~0.19 compute + ~0.15 licence). Use the AHB Workbook from FinOps Toolkit for
   compliance tracking across the fleet.

2. **Savings Plans for Compute cover more than VMs.** Unlike Reservations (which are
   resource-specific), Compute Savings Plans also cover Container Instances and App
   Service Premium v3 / Isolated v2. If you run a mix of VMs, containers, and App
   Service, a Compute Savings Plan is the only instrument that covers all three.

3. **Reservations offer deeper discounts but less flexibility.** A Reservation locks to
   a specific VM family and region. If you change instance family or region mid-term, the
   Reservation does not follow. A Savings Plan is spend-based and applies wherever it
   finds eligible usage - but the discount is ~7% shallower than a Reservation.

4. **Azure allows Reservation exchanges and refunds - but with limits.** You can exchange
   a Reservation for a different SKU (same or higher value) or request a pro-rated refund
   up to $50,000 per rolling 12 months. This is significantly more liquidity than AWS
   offers (where Savings Plans cannot be modified and Standard RIs can only be sold on
   the marketplace). However, Microsoft has been tightening these policies - verify
   current exchange and refund terms before relying on them for liquidity.

5. **Savings Plans cannot be exchanged, cancelled, or refunded** once purchased. The
   commitment runs for the full term. This makes phased purchasing and portfolio
   diversification critical for Savings Plans (see "Commitment portfolio liquidity" below).

6. **Spot is not a commitment** - it is a market mechanism with a 30-second eviction
   notice and no SLA. It belongs in the compute cost strategy but should not be compared
   directly against commitment instruments.

### Compute commitment decision tree

```
START: What Azure compute service runs the workload?
│
├── Virtual Machines (including VMSS)
│   │
│   ├── Does the VM run Windows Server or SQL Server with SA licenses?
│   │   └── YES → Enable Azure Hybrid Benefit immediately (up to 40-55%
│   │             savings, no commitment, no restart). Then continue below
│   │             for additional commitment discounts on top of AHB.
│   │
│   ├── Is the workload fault-tolerant and interruptible?
│   │   ├── YES → Use Spot VMs (up to 90% discount)
│   │   │         - Start with 20-30% Spot allocation in non-production
│   │   │         - Use VMSS with Spot priority for auto-scaling pools
│   │   │         - Implement eviction handling (30-second notice)
│   │   │         - Good for: batch, dev/test, CI/CD, stateless tiers
│   │   │
│   │   └── NO → Is the workload stable and predictable (90+ days)?
│   │       ├── NO → Stay on PAYG. Re-evaluate quarterly.
│   │       │
│   │       └── YES → Has it been right-sized? (see Compute rightsizing below)
│   │           ├── NO → Right-size first. Do not commit to waste.
│   │           │
│   │           └── YES → Will it stay on the same VM family + region?
│   │               ├── YES → Azure Reservation (up to 72%)
│   │               │         Deepest discount. Can be exchanged for a
│   │               │         different SKU if workload changes (subject
│   │               │         to exchange policy limits).
│   │               │
│   │               └── NO / UNSURE → Savings Plan for Compute (up to 65%)
│   │                     Covers any VM family and region. ~7% shallower
│   │                     than Reservations but protects against family
│   │                     or region changes. Cannot be exchanged or
│   │                     refunded once purchased.
│   │
│   └── Special case: GPU / N-series VMs
│       - Capacity scarcity is a primary concern (NC, ND, NV families)
│       - Reservations may be necessary to secure capacity in constrained regions
│       - Savings Plans do not reserve capacity - only provide pricing benefit
│       - For ML training: consider Spot VMs with checkpointing
│
├── Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
│   │
│   ├── AKS node pools run on VMs → commitment applies to underlying VMs
│   │   (use VM decision tree above for node pool instances)
│   │
│   ├── Spot node pools → use Spot priority for fault-tolerant pods
│   │   - Configure pod disruption budgets for graceful eviction
│   │   - Use taints/tolerations to isolate Spot-eligible workloads
│   │   - Can save 60-90% on non-critical node pools
│   │
│   └── Consider: cluster autoscaler + right-sized node pools before committing
│       Pod rightsizing (VPA) saves 20-40%; node pool rightsizing saves 15-30%.
│       Commit after these optimisations are stable, not before.
│
├── App Service
│   │
│   ├── Consumption Plan → no commitment needed (pay per execution)
│   │
│   ├── Premium v3 / Isolated v2 → Savings Plan for Compute applies
│   │   - Only relevant if App Service spend is significant (>$2K/month)
│   │   - Reservations also available for Isolated tier
│   │
│   └── Legacy plans (V2) → migrate to V3 first for better price-performance,
│       then evaluate commitment on the new tier
│
├── Azure Functions
│   │
│   ├── Consumption Plan → pay per execution, no commitment available
│   │   - Focus on optimising execution duration and memory allocation
│   │
│   ├── Premium Plan → runs on App Service infrastructure
│   │   Savings Plan for Compute applies. But first: does the workload
│   │   actually need Premium? Move non-critical functions to Consumption
│   │   Plan before committing to Premium.
│   │
│   └── Dedicated (App Service Plan) → same as App Service above
│
├── Container Instances
│   │
│   └── Savings Plan for Compute covers Container Instances
│       - Only worth committing if usage is sustained and predictable
│       - For short-lived or burst containers, PAYG is usually cheaper
│
└── Azure Databricks
    │
    └── Databricks has its own commitment model (DBCU pre-purchase)
        - Separate from Azure Reservations and Savings Plans
        - See finops-databricks.md for Databricks-specific guidance
```

### Savings Plan vs Reservation - detailed comparison

| Dimension | Azure Reservation | Azure Savings Plan for Compute |
|---|---|---|
| Commitment | Specific SKU for 1yr or 3yr | $/hr spend for 1yr or 3yr |
| Discount depth | Up to 72% | Up to 65% |
| VM family | Locked to one family | Any family |
| Region | Locked to one region | Any region |
| Size | Flexible within family (instance size flexibility) | Any size |
| Covers App Service | Isolated tier only | Premium v3 + Isolated v2 |
| Covers Container Instances | No | Yes |
| Exchangeable | Yes (for equal or greater value, $50K/12mo refund cap) | No |
| Refundable | Pro-rated, up to $50K per 12 months | No |
| Cancellable | Yes (with early termination fee) | No |
| Payment options | Monthly or Upfront | Monthly or Upfront |
| Scoping | Subscription, resource group, management group, shared | Subscription, resource group, management group, shared |

**Key takeaway:** Reservations offer deeper discounts AND more liquidity (exchanges,
refunds). Savings Plans offer broader coverage but zero liquidity once purchased. This
inverts the common assumption that "flexibility = Savings Plans." For Azure specifically,
Reservations are often the better choice when workloads are moderately stable, because
you retain the ability to exchange if things change.

### Spot Virtual Machines

For fault-tolerant, interruptible workloads, Spot offers up to 90% discount over PAYG.

**Appropriate for Spot:** Batch processing, dev/test, CI/CD, stateless pods in AKS,
ML training with checkpointing, scale-out processing with VMSS.

**Not appropriate:** Stateful databases, workloads with strict SLA requirements,
single-instance workloads with no failover.

**Key constraint:** 30-second eviction notice (vs 2 minutes on AWS), no SLA guarantees.

**Spot best practices:**
- Start with 20-30% Spot allocation in non-production, increase based on stability
- Use VMSS with Spot priority for auto-scaling pools with automatic fallback
- Configure eviction policy: Deallocate (preserves disk) or Delete (lowest cost)
- Set max price at PAYG rate - never bid above PAYG
- For AKS: use Spot node pools with taints/tolerations for workload isolation
- Monitor eviction rates by VM family and region - some combinations are more stable

### Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)

Organisations with existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses (with Software
Assurance) can apply them to Azure resources, eliminating the licence premium.

**Why AHB is the #1 quick win:**
- Up to 40% savings on Windows VMs, up to 55% on SQL Database
- No architectural change, no restart needed - single CLI command per VM
- Also applies to SQL Managed Instance and Red Hat/SUSE Linux
- Zero commitment, zero risk, immediate effect
- Use the AHB Workbook from FinOps Toolkit for compliance tracking across the fleet
- **Enable on all eligible VMs before evaluating any other commitment**

### Compute commitment layering strategy

Azure applies discounts in a specific order. The layering sequence matters.

**Discount application order (Azure-defined):**
1. Azure Hybrid Benefit (licence overlay, applied first to eligible VMs)
2. Spot pricing (market rate, for Spot-eligible workloads)
3. Reservations (capacity-based, applied to matching PAYG usage)
4. Savings Plans (spend-based, applied to remaining eligible PAYG usage)
5. MACC discount (portfolio-wide, applied last to remaining spend)

**Recommended layering approach:**

```
Layer 0: Azure Hybrid Benefit (free - no commitment, immediate)
  ↓ eliminates licence cost on all eligible Windows/SQL VMs
Layer 1: Spot (for interruptible workloads)
  ↓ removes 15-40% of compute from the commitment equation
Layer 2: Savings Plans for Compute (broad baseline)
  ↓ covers predictable floor across VMs/App Service/Container Instances
Layer 3: Reservations (high-stability VM workloads)
  ↓ captures the extra ~7% discount for workloads locked to a family+region
  ↓ retains exchange/refund liquidity if workload changes
Layer 4: MACC (portfolio-wide, if applicable)
  ↓ applies on top of everything above for remaining PAYG spend
Layer 5: PAYG (variable / new workloads)
  ↓ buffer for growth, experimentation, and workloads under evaluation
```

**Sizing the commitment - the 70/20/10 guideline:**
- **70% of steady-state compute:** covered by Savings Plans and/or Reservations
- **20% variable buffer:** PAYG capacity for scaling, new workloads, seasonal variation
- **10% Spot opportunity:** fault-tolerant workloads on Spot pricing

### Database commitment decision tree

Azure offers two commitment instruments for database services, plus operational
optimisations that should be applied before any commitment purchase.

**Pre-commitment optimisation (do these first):**
1. Enable Azure Hybrid Benefit on all eligible SQL Database and SQL MI instances
2. Switch dev/test databases to SQL Serverless (auto-pause) - saves 70-90% on idle DBs
3. Stop PostgreSQL/MySQL Flexible Servers outside business hours
4. Consolidate small databases into Elastic Pools (20-40% savings)
5. Review DTU vs vCore: migrate to vCore if AHB-eligible for licence savings
6. Right-size overprovisioned compute and storage tiers

**Decision tree:**

```
Is the database workload stable and predictable (90+ days)?
├── NO → Stay on PAYG or use Serverless (auto-pause for intermittent use).
│         Re-evaluate quarterly.
│
└── YES → Has the database been right-sized and optimised? (steps 1-6 above)
    ├── NO → Optimise first, commit second. Do not lock in waste.
    │
    └── YES → What is the database estate profile?
        │
        ├── Single service, single region, stable configuration
        │   → Azure Reservation (deeper discount than Savings Plan)
        │     - Available for: SQL Database, Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL,
        │       MySQL, MariaDB, SQL MI
        │     - Exchangeable for different SKU if workload changes
        │     - Pro-rated refund available (up to $50K/12 months)
        │
        ├── Multiple database services or regions
        │   → Savings Plan for Databases (up to 35%, March 2026)
        │     - Covers: SQL Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cosmos DB,
        │       SQL MI, MariaDB
        │     - Applies savings across services and regions automatically
        │     - Cannot be exchanged or refunded once purchased
        │     - CAUTION: SQL Server on Azure VMs and Azure Arc consume
        │       the commitment at PAYG rates (no discount) - factor
        │       this into sizing the hourly commitment
        │
        ├── Mix of stable and evolving workloads
        │   → Layer both: Savings Plan for Databases as broad baseline,
        │     then add Reservations for the most stable, high-spend
        │     database instances to capture deeper discounts
        │
        └── Cosmos DB (special case)
            → Cosmos DB Reserved Capacity available separately
              - 1yr or 3yr terms, significant discounts on RU/s
              - Requires predictable throughput baseline
              - For variable throughput: use autoscale (no commitment)
              - Evaluate serverless for low/intermittent usage first
```

**Database commitment diagnostic questions:**
- What percentage of your database spend is PAYG vs committed?
- Are Azure Hybrid Benefit licences applied to all eligible SQL instances?
- Are dev/test databases on Serverless (auto-pause) or still running 24/7?
- Do you have SQL Server on Azure VMs that would consume a Database Savings Plan
  at PAYG rates? If so, how much of the plan's hourly commitment would they absorb?
- Are overprovisioned tiers (Business Critical on non-prod, RA-GRS backup storage
  on non-critical DBs) inflating the baseline you would commit to?

### Commitment portfolio liquidity

Commitment liquidity - the ability to reshape, rebalance, or exit your commitment
portfolio without wasting money - is as important as discount depth. Azure offers
more built-in liquidity mechanisms than AWS, but each has limits.

**Azure liquidity mechanisms:**

| Mechanism | How it works | Applies to | Limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reservation exchange** | Swap a Reservation for a different SKU of equal or greater value | Reservations only | Must be equal or greater value; exchanges count toward $50K refund cap |
| **Reservation refund** | Cancel a Reservation and receive a pro-rated refund | Reservations only | $50,000 rolling 12-month cap across all refunds and exchanges |
| **Reservation instance size flexibility** | A Reservation on one VM size covers other sizes in the same family at a normalised ratio | VM Reservations | Same VM family and region only |
| **Staggered expiry** | Purchase commitments in phased blocks so only a fraction expires each quarter | All instruments (Reservations, Savings Plans) | Requires purchasing discipline |

**Key insight:** Reservations are more liquid than Savings Plans on Azure. This is the
opposite of the common assumption. Savings Plans offer usage flexibility (any family,
any region) but zero financial liquidity (no exchange, no refund, no cancellation).
Reservations lock to a specific SKU but allow exchanges, refunds, and instance size
flexibility. When choosing between the two, factor liquidity into the decision - not
just discount depth and coverage breadth.

**The $50,000 refund cap:**
Microsoft imposes a rolling 12-month cap of $50,000 across all Reservation refunds
and exchanges that result in a decrease in value. For organisations with large
Reservation portfolios, this cap can be a binding constraint. If you need to reshape
more than $50,000 in Reservations within a year, you will hit the ceiling. Plan
exchanges early and spread them across the 12-month window.

### Phased purchasing

Never buy the full commitment in a single transaction. Purchase in blocks to create
a portfolio with staggered expiry dates. The cadence and block size should match your
consumption profile - not a fixed rule.

**Why phased purchasing matters on Azure:**
- **Reduces lock-in risk:** if workloads migrate or are re-architected, only the
  current block is at risk
- **Creates natural re-evaluation points:** each purchase cycle forces a review of
  utilisation, Advisor recommendations, and architecture direction
- **Preserves refund/exchange headroom:** spreading purchases means smaller individual
  Reservations, making it easier to stay within the $50K refund cap if changes are needed
- **Aligns with MACC cadence:** phased purchasing can be timed to support MACC burndown
  trajectory, avoiding end-of-period scrambles
- **Captures pricing improvements:** newer VM generations (v5, v6) and architecture
  shifts (ARM-based Dps/Eps families) can be reflected in subsequent blocks

**Cadence and block size by consumption profile:**

The purchasing cadence should follow consumption volatility. The more variable the
workload, the shorter the purchase cycle and the smaller each block. Your commitment
refresh rate should be faster than your workload change rate.

| Consumption profile | Examples | Cadence | Block size | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Steady, predictable | Enterprise ERP, internal tools, back-office systems | Quarterly | 20-25% | Workloads barely move quarter to quarter. Larger blocks capture deeper coverage faster. |
| Moderate growth or gradual shifts | SaaS platforms, B2B applications, steady API services | Monthly to bi-monthly | 10-15% | Growth adds new capacity regularly. Smaller blocks incorporate new workloads without over-committing to the old baseline. |
| Seasonal or event-driven | Retail (holiday peaks), media (live events), gaming (launches) | Monthly to weekly | 5-10% | Demand swings mean the baseline shifts frequently. Small blocks commit only to the proven floor; peaks stay on PAYG/Spot. |
| Highly volatile or early-stage | Startups, experimental workloads, pre-product-market-fit | Weekly or do not commit | 5% or less | If you cannot predict next month, do not lock in for a year. Stay on PAYG with Spot until patterns stabilise. |

**The cadence can shift over time for the same company.** A retail company might buy
quarterly in Q1-Q3 (steady baseline) and switch to weekly in Q4 (holiday ramp) to
avoid committing to peak capacity that evaporates in January. A SaaS company might
start with monthly cadence during a growth phase and shift to quarterly once the
growth rate stabilises.

**Block size and cadence are inversely related:** higher frequency = smaller blocks.
This keeps the total portfolio size similar but distributes the risk across more,
smaller decisions.

**Azure-specific consideration:** on Azure, Reservations can be exchanged mid-term,
so organisations with moderate-frequency cadence (monthly/bi-monthly) can favour
Reservations over Savings Plans - the exchange mechanism provides an additional
liquidity layer on top of the staggered expiry approach. Organisations buying weekly
may prefer Savings Plans to avoid the administrative overhead of frequent Reservation
management.

**Phased purchasing framework (quarterly example for steady consumption):**

```
Quarter 1: Buy 20-25% of target commitment (the floor you are certain about)
  → Monitor utilisation for 30 days via Azure Advisor and Cost Management
  → If utilisation >80%: proceed to next block
  → If utilisation <80%: investigate before buying more

Quarter 2: Buy next 15-20% block
  → Reassess workload stability and architecture plans
  → Review Reservation exchange opportunities on earlier blocks if workloads shifted

Quarter 3: Buy next 15-20% block
  → By now 50-65% of target is covered
  → Remaining gap is intentional PAYG buffer

Quarter 4: Evaluate whether to buy more or hold
  → Factor MACC burndown position into the decision
  → Early blocks from previous year start approaching renewal
```

**Portfolio view - staggered expiry example (1-year terms, quarterly cadence):**

| Block | Purchased | Expires | % of total | Instrument | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Block 1 | Jan 2026 | Jan 2027 | 25% | Compute Savings Plan | Broad baseline across VMs + App Service |
| Block 2 | Apr 2026 | Apr 2027 | 20% | VM Reservations (D-series) | Stable production VMs, deepest discount |
| Block 3 | Jul 2026 | Jul 2027 | 15% | VM Reservations (E-series) | Memory-optimised database VMs |
| Block 4 | Oct 2026 | Oct 2027 | 10% | DB Savings Plan | Database baseline across SQL + PostgreSQL |
| PAYG | - | - | 30% | None | Buffer for variable / new workloads |

**3-year term phasing:**
For 3-year commitments (deeper discounts), purchase in smaller blocks (10-15%) at
6-month intervals. The longer the term, the smaller each block should be.

**Portfolio management cadence:**
- **At each purchase cycle** (weekly/monthly/quarterly depending on profile): review
  Reservation and Savings Plan utilisation in Azure Cost Management. Flag any commitment
  below 80%. Decide whether to buy the next block, adjust the mix, or pause. Review
  Reservation exchange opportunities on earlier blocks if workloads have shifted.
- **At each expiry:** do not auto-renew blindly. Re-evaluate the workload: has it
  grown, shrunk, migrated, or been decommissioned? Renew only what is still justified.
  Azure Advisor provides renewal recommendations - use them as input, not as the decision.
- **Quarterly (regardless of purchase cadence):** strategic review of commitment
  coverage ratio, instrument mix, MACC burndown trajectory, and upcoming expiries.
- **Annually:** review the overall commitment strategy against the organisation's Azure
  roadmap. Adjust coverage ratio, cadence, instrument mix, and MACC alignment.

**Commitment portfolio diagnostic questions:**
- What percentage of your commitment portfolio expires in any single quarter? If more
  than 30%, the portfolio is insufficiently diversified.
- Are you buying commitments in phased blocks with staggered expiry, or purchasing the
  full amount in a single transaction?
- How much of your $50,000 Reservation refund/exchange cap have you used in the last
  12 months? If you are close to the cap, you have less room to reshape the portfolio.
- Are Savings Plans covering workloads that are stable enough for Reservations (leaving
  ~7% discount on the table)?
- Is MACC burndown tracking integrated into the same review cadence as commitment
  purchasing? If not, optimisation gains may create a MACC shortfall risk.
- Are engineering teams planning VM family migrations (e.g. to ARM-based Dps/Eps) that
  would strand existing Reservations? If so, favour Savings Plans for those workloads
  or plan Reservation exchanges in advance.

**Key metrics:**
- **Reservation/SP Utilisation:** Target >80%. Below this, the commitment is oversized.
- **Reservation/SP Coverage:** Target 70% (Walk maturity), 80%+ (Run maturity).
- **Effective Savings Rate:** actual savings / theoretical maximum. Measures how well
  commitments are matched to real usage.
- **Break-even period:** should be <9 months for 1-year terms, <15 months for 3-year.
- **Commitment waste:** hours where committed capacity had no matching usage.
- **Exchange headroom:** remaining $ available under the $50K/12-month refund cap.

**Pre-purchase checklist:**
- [ ] Azure Hybrid Benefit enabled on all eligible VMs and SQL instances
- [ ] Workload has run stably for 90+ days
- [ ] Workload has been right-sized (do not commit to waste)
- [ ] No planned architecture changes during the commitment term
- [ ] All resources are tagged and attributable to an owner
- [ ] Existing commitment utilisation is >80% before purchasing more
- [ ] MACC burndown trajectory reviewed - commitment purchase aligns with drawdown
- [ ] Finance has approved the capital outlay (for Upfront payments)

### Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)

A MACC is a contractual agreement to spend a defined dollar amount on Azure services over
a set period, typically one to three years. In exchange, Microsoft offers tiered discounts -
the higher the commitment, the better the terms.

**Critical distinction:** A MACC is a binding obligation, not a forecast. If actual
consumption falls short of the committed amount by the end of the term, Microsoft issues a
shortfall invoice. The discount negotiated becomes an additional cost if the target is missed.

**The optimisation paradox**

The MACC is typically sized based on current architecture and projected growth. When a FinOps
team then rightsizes VMs, decommissions idle resources, and applies Reservations or Savings
Plans, every dollar saved through optimisation is a dollar that does not draw down against the
MACC. The burndown rate - how fast actual spend reduces the remaining commitment balance -
starts to lag. If the gap is significant, the final quarter becomes a scramble to close it.

This is the core tension: the MACC and the FinOps programme can quietly stop working in the
same direction unless burndown tracking is integrated into optimisation reporting.

**What counts toward MACC drawdown:**
- Core Azure services consumed under the enrollment
- Azure Reservations for compute
- Azure Marketplace purchases carrying the "Azure benefit eligible" badge, transacted through
  the Azure portal under a subscription tied to the enrollment

**What does not count:**
- Marketplace purchases made by credit card directly on the Marketplace website (the purchase
  path matters even for eligible products)
- Hybrid licensing applied to on-premises workloads
- Azure Prepayment credits used to fund Marketplace purchases (billing mechanics separate
  these from MACC consumption, even though it feels like they should count)

**Reporting pitfall:** Azure Cost Management surfaces both actual cost and amortised cost
views. They produce different burndown numbers. Actual cost reflects when charges are billed.
Amortised cost spreads upfront Reservation purchases across the coverage term. Without a fixed
internal standard for which view to use - applied consistently in what gets shared with
Microsoft - the commitment can appear ahead or behind depending on who pulls the number.

**Operational guidance:**
- Include MACC burndown rate in FinOps reporting alongside ESR (Effective Savings Rate) and
  commitment coverage. When burndown slows while ESR improves, that is the signal to act
- Review required monthly burn rate alongside optimisation metrics in the same session
- Keep procurement and FinOps in the same cadence review at least quarterly
- Maintain a forward-looking list of planned software purchases with MACC eligibility confirmed
  in advance, and pace them to support the burndown trajectory
- Confirm Marketplace eligibility at planning time, not at purchase time
- Do not treat Marketplace as a mechanism for spending toward a target - purchases made
  primarily because they count create vendor relationships, licensing costs, and integration
  work that were never in the original business case

## Compute rightsizing

### VM cost model

**Cost drivers:** Compute (SKU, hours, licensing), storage (managed disks),
networking (egress), indirect costs (monitoring, backups).

**Critical insight:** When stopped (deallocated), you still pay for storage and
public IPs. You save compute and license costs.

### VM SKU naming convention

Understanding Azure VM names is essential for rightsizing decisions:

```
D 4 a s _v5
│ │ │ │   │
│ │ │ │   └── Generation (newer = better price/performance)
│ │ │ └────── Premium storage support
│ │ └──────── AMD CPU (cheaper than Intel)
│ └────────── vCPU count
└──────────── Family (D=general, B=burstable, E=memory, F=compute, N=GPU)
```

**Other modifiers:** `p` = ARM CPU (cheapest, requires workload compatibility),
`m` = more memory, `d` = local temp SSD.

### VM family selection

| Family | Memory per vCPU | Best for | Cost position |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B-series** | Varies | Spiky, mostly-idle workloads (dev/test, small web) | 15-55% cheaper than D-series |
| **D-series** | 4 GB | General purpose | Baseline |
| **E-series** | 8 GB | Memory-optimized (databases, caches) | Premium over D |
| **F-series** | 2 GB | Compute-optimized (batch, gaming) | Cheaper per vCPU |

**AMD-based variants** (Das, Eas): Better price/performance vs Intel equivalents.
**ARM-based variants** (Dps, Eps): Cheapest option for compatible workloads (web, containers).

### Azure Advisor for rightsizing

Azure Advisor provides cost optimization recommendations based on CPU/memory utilization
from Azure Monitor.

**Rightsizing with Azure Advisor:**
- Access via Azure Portal > Advisor > Cost tab
- Recommendations based on 7-30 days of utilization data (configurable)
- Uses P95 CPU utilization as primary metric
- Shows estimated monthly savings per recommendation
- Can be exported to CSV for bulk review

**Azure Advisor limitations:**
- Conservative recommendations - does not account for SKU feature constraints
- Don't follow blindly - always validate with workload owners
- Missing memory analysis if Azure Monitor agent not installed
- Doesn't catch network-intensive workloads that appear CPU-idle

**Manual rightsizing approach:** Monitor CPU (avg, max, P95), memory, network I/O over
30 days. Candidates: VMs with <20% avg CPU utilization. RI opportunities: VMs with >80%
uptime.

### Automated start/stop schedules

The highest-impact quick win for non-production environments.

**Savings math:** Office hours (10h x 5 days/week = 217h/month vs 730h/month) = up to
70% cost reduction on non-production compute.

**Implementation options:**
- Azure DevTest Labs auto-shutdown (simplest, shutdown only)
- **Start/Stop VMs v2** (Microsoft recommended, supports both start and stop)
- Azure Automation Runbooks (most customizable)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform `azurerm_dev_test_schedule`, Bicep)

**Tagging strategy for automation:** Use `startTime` and `stopTime` tags on VMs.
Automation reads tags to determine schedule. This allows per-VM scheduling without
modifying the automation logic.

### VM generation upgrades

Newer VM generations improve price/performance ratio. Examples:
- D2s_v3 > D2s_v5: sometimes cheaper AND better performance
- E4_v3 > E4as_v5: AMD variant gives further savings

Review VM generations quarterly and upgrade where possible.

### Region placement for cost

Azure pricing varies significantly by region. India is cheaper, Brazil is expensive.
Dev/test workloads can often use cheaper regions without user-facing impact.
Use the Retail Prices API to compare regions programmatically.

---

## Database cost optimization

### Azure SQL Serverless (auto-pause)

**Best for:** Dev/test databases, intermittent usage, low average utilization.

- Auto-pause delay: configurable 1-7 days (or disabled)
- Auto-resume: automatic on first connection
- Billing: per-second compute; storage charged even when paused
- 100% automated - no scripts or runbooks needed

**Key decision:** Higher per-second compute rate than provisioned, but if the database is
idle most of the time, total cost is much lower.

### Elastic Pools

Share compute resources across multiple databases on the same logical server.

**Best for:** SaaS apps (one DB per tenant), databases with different peak times,
consolidation of small databases.

**Savings:** 20-40% cost reduction vs individual databases. Constraint: must be same
logical server, region, subscription.

### DTU vs vCore pricing

- **DTU:** Predictable pricing, good for small/uncertain workloads
- **vCore:** Better for migrations (license reuse via AHB), more control over compute/storage
- **Serverless (vCore):** Higher hourly rate but auto-pause makes it cheaper for intermittent use

### PostgreSQL/MySQL Flexible Server start/stop

- Manual start/stop via Portal, CLI, or API
- When stopped: **70-80% cost reduction** (storage-only billing)
- Auto-restart after 7 days (PostgreSQL) or 30 days (MySQL) if not manually started
- HA must be disabled for start/stop to work
- Ideal for dev/test environments

### Savings Plan for Databases (announced March 2026)

A spend-based commitment discount for eligible database services. Customers commit to a
fixed hourly spend (e.g. $5/hr) for one year and receive discounted prices - up to 35%
vs PAYG on select services. The plan applies savings automatically each hour, prioritising
the usage that delivers the greatest discount first, across services and regions.

**Eligible services:** Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database
for MySQL, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Database for MariaDB.

**Important caveat:** SQL Server on Azure VMs and SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc also
consume the plan's hourly commitment, but at normal PAYG rates (no discount). If these
workloads are in the mix, they reduce the effective savings from the plan. Factor this
into sizing the hourly commitment.

**Scoping:** Subscription, resource group, management group, or entire billing account.

**Purchase options:** Monthly or upfront payment, optional auto-renewal. Personalised
recommendations available in Azure Advisor and the Azure portal.

**When to use vs Reservations:**
- Choose Savings Plan for Databases when the database estate spans multiple services or
  regions, or when architecture changes (migrations, service swaps) are expected during
  the commitment period.
- Choose Reservations when a single database service runs stably in a fixed configuration
  and the deeper RI discount outweighs the flexibility benefit.
- Layer both: use the Savings Plan for broad baseline coverage, then add RIs for the
  most stable, high-spend database workloads.

**Pricing note (March 2026):** The "up to 35%" figure is based on Azure SQL Database
Serverless over a 1-year term. Actual discounts vary by service and usage pattern. Azure
Pricing Calculator and pricing pages had not yet been updated at time of announcement -
verify current rates before purchasing.

### Database architecture principles

- **Only keep active working set in relational DB.** Move cold data to Blob (Cool/Archive tier).
- **Avoid "one instance per application" by default.** Consolidate databases to increase utilization.
- **Active data in Premium, cold data in Blob.** Avoid storing backups on premium disks.
- **High availability has a cost.** Balance resilience requirements against budget per environment.

---

## Storage cost optimization

### Blob lifecycle management

**Tier pricing (approximate, per GB/month):**

| Tier | Price | Best for | Minimum retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hot | ~$0.018 | Frequent access | None |
| Cool | ~$0.01 | Infrequent (30+ days) | 30 days |
| Archive | ~$0.002 | Rare access (compliance) | 180 days |

**Typical lifecycle policy:**
1. Move to Cool after 30 days of no access (50% savings)
2. Move to Archive after 90 days (90% savings)
3. Delete temporary/log data after 180 days

**Lifecycle actions:** `tierToCool`, `tierToArchive`, `delete`,
`enableAutoTierToHotFromCool` (auto-promote on access).

### Ephemeral OS disks

- **Savings:** 100% on OS disk storage costs (uses VM cache or temp disk instead)
- Best for stateless workloads, scale sets, dev/test VMs
- Requirement: VM must support ephemeral disks, cache/temp disk >= OS disk size
- Example: 100 VMs x 128GB P10 disks = ~$640/month eliminated

### Recovery Services Vault archive

- Archive tier: ~$0.0025/GB/month vs Standard: ~$0.05/GB/month = **95% savings**
- Move backups >90 days old to archive tier automatically
- Example: 10TB backup archive saves ~$486/month vs Standard tier

### Snapshot and version cleanup

- Lifecycle policies can auto-delete old blob versions and snapshots
- Enable blob versioning for data protection, then auto-delete versions >30 days
- Snapshot cleanup alone can reduce storage costs 20-40%

---

## Monitoring cost optimization (Log Analytics)

Log Analytics is a hidden cost driver. Unmanaged, it can exceed the cost of the
workloads it monitors.

### Pricing structure

- **Ingestion:** ~$2.50/GB (first 5GB/day free per subscription)
- **Retention:** First 30 days included, then ~$0.10/GB/month for 31-730 days
- **Archive:** ~$0.02/GB/month (data >90 days)
- **Commitment tiers** (high-volume workspaces): 100GB/day = 22% savings, 200GB/day = 27%,
  500GB/day = 36%

### Top cost control actions

**1. Set daily ingestion cap**
- Prevents cost spikes from misconfigured apps, verbose logging, or security incidents
- Set at 120-150% of normal daily usage
- Configure alerts at 80% and 100% of cap
- **Warning:** When cap is reached, data collection stops until next day

**2. Optimize retention**
- Operational logs: 30 days (included in ingestion cost)
- Security logs: 90 days (if compliance requires it)
- Everything else: 30 days default
- Extending retention from 30 to 90 days doubles cost

**3. Filter verbose sources**
- Container Insights filtering: 40-60% ingestion reduction
- Application Insights sampling (50% sample rate = 50% savings)
- Performance counter optimization: 30-40% reduction
- Disable verbose diagnostic settings on unused resources

**4. Use Basic Logs for low-value data**
- Basic Logs: ~$0.60/GB (50% cheaper), limited retention (30 days), limited queries
- Use for verbose, low-value logs; keep Analytics tier for important operational/security logs

**5. Table-level retention**
- SecurityEvent: 90+ days (compliance)
- Heartbeat: 30 days
- Perf counters: 30 days
- ContainerLog: 7-30 days

### Cost impact examples

| Scenario | Before | After | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Optimize retention (500GB/mo, 90d > 30d) | $2,750/mo | $1,250/mo | 55% |
| Filter container logs (error/warn only) | 30GB/day | 12GB/day | 60% |
| Commitment tier (150GB/day) | $11,250/mo | $8,820/mo | 22% |

## AKS (Kubernetes) cost optimization

### Key cost drivers

1. Node pool sizing (VM SKUs) - largest cost component
2. Node count and autoscaling configuration
3. Storage (Premium vs Standard disks)
4. Networking (load balancers, public IPs, egress)
5. Add-ons (monitoring, security)

### Optimization strategies

**Pod rightsizing:**
- Set appropriate resource requests and limits on all pods
- Methodology: Monitor actual usage 2-4 weeks > Set requests at P80 > Set limits at
  P95 or 2x requests > Review quarterly
- Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for automated recommendations
- **Savings: 20-40%**

**Node pool rightsizing:**
- Match node sizes to pod requirements
- Use multiple node pools for different workload types
- Enable cluster autoscaler for dynamic scaling
- **Savings: 15-30%**

**Spot node pools:**
- 60-90% discount on node compute costs
- Use taints and tolerations to place only fault-tolerant, stateless pods on spot nodes
- Start with 20-30% spot allocation, increase based on stability
- **Savings: 60-90%**

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
- Scale pods based on CPU/memory or custom metrics
- Reduce pod count during low traffic, scale during peaks
- **Savings: 20-50%**

### Policy-based governance with Kyverno

Kyverno policies automate cost governance in AKS clusters:
- Enforce node affinity rules (ensure workloads land on correct, cost-optimized pools)
- Prevent expensive workloads on general-purpose nodes
- Enable workload isolation for chargeback/showback
- Require resource requests/limits on all pods

---

## Cost allocation on Azure

### Billing scope hierarchy

```
Billing Account
 > Management Group (org-level governance)
    > Subscription (primary isolation boundary)
       > Resource Group (workload grouping)
          > Resource (individual service)
```

**Allocation strategy:**
- Use Management Groups for policy inheritance and org-level cost views
- Use Subscriptions as the primary cost allocation boundary (equivalent to AWS accounts)
- Use Resource Groups to group resources by workload or team within a subscription
- Use Tags for cross-cutting dimensions (Environment, CostCenter, Project)

### Azure-specific tagging considerations

**Key difference from AWS:** Azure supports tag inheritance policies through Azure Policy.
Resources can inherit tags from their resource group or subscription automatically. This
simplifies governance for teams that organize resources by resource group.

**Tag enforcement policies (Azure Policy):**
- `deny` effect: Block resource creation without mandatory tags
- `audit` effect: Flag non-compliant resources without blocking
- `modify` effect: Auto-apply tags from resource group to child resources
- Tag inheritance from subscription level and resource group level

**Tags for automation:** Beyond cost allocation, use tags to drive automation:
- `startTime` / `stopTime` for VM scheduling
- `Environment` (dev/pre/pro) for policy differentiation
- `Owner` for accountability and notification routing

**Resource Group naming convention (recommended):**
Pattern: `rg-{bu3chars}-{name}-{env}` (e.g., `rg-fin-webapp-dev`)

---

## Governance tools

### Azure Policy for FinOps

Azure Policy enforces organizational standards across subscriptions. Key FinOps policies:

| Policy | Effect | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Require mandatory tags | `deny` | Block untagged resource creation |
| Audit tag compliance | `audit` | Visibility into tagging gaps |
| Inherit tags from resource group | `modify` | Automatic tag propagation |
| Allowed VM SKUs | `deny` | Prevent expensive GPU/M-series in dev |
| Allowed disk SKUs | `deny` | Block UltraSSD/PremiumV2 in non-prod |
| Allowed storage SKUs | `deny` | Restrict to Standard_LRS/ZRS |
| Deny expensive SQL tiers | `deny` | Only allow Basic/Standard/GeneralPurpose |
| Deny public IPs | `deny` | Use Bastion/VPN instead (cost + security) |
| Restrict regions | `deny` | Enforce approved regions |
| Enforce VM shutdown schedule | `audit` | Flag VMs without auto-shutdown tags |

**Assign policies at Management Group scope** for org-wide enforcement.
Use remediation tasks to apply `modify` policies to existing resources retroactively.

### Azure Budgets and Alerts

Configure at minimum:
- Subscription-level monthly budget with 80% and 100% actual cost alerts
- Forecasted cost alert at 100% (triggers before the budget is exceeded)
- Resource group level budgets for high-spend workloads

**Alert recipients:** Both the FinOps practitioner and the engineering team lead.
FinOps-only alerts create a bottleneck; engineering-only alerts lack financial context.

Use Action Groups for automated responses (Logic Apps, Azure Functions, webhooks).

### Environment definitions

Formalize environment tiers with different governance levels:

| Environment | Allowed SKUs | Schedule | Commitment eligible | Backup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sandbox | B-series only | Auto-delete after 7 days | No | No |
| Dev | B-series, small D/E | Business hours only | No | No |
| Pre-Production | Match prod families, smaller | Business hours only | No | Optional |
| Production | Any approved | 24/7 | Yes (after 90-day stability) | Yes |

**Principle: Shut down waste before committing to anything.** Reduce baseline cost first,
then layer commitments (RIs, Savings Plans) on top of the optimized baseline.

---

## Azure-specific quick wins

Ordered by priority: highest savings + lowest risk first.

| # | Action | Typical savings | Risk | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Enable Azure Hybrid Benefit on eligible VMs | Up to 40-55% on license cost | None | Very Low |
| 2 | Schedule dev/test VM auto-shutdown (business hours) | 60-70% of VM cost | Low | Low |
| 3 | Delete unattached managed disks | 100% of disk cost | None | Low |
| 4 | Remove unassociated public IP addresses | 100% of IP cost | None | Low |
| 5 | Shut down idle VMs (CPU <5% for 14+ days) | 100% of VM compute cost | Low | Low |
| 6 | Move cold blob storage to Cool or Archive tier | 50-90% storage cost | Low | Low |
| 7 | Set Log Analytics daily cap + optimize retention | 30-60% monitoring cost | Low | Low |
| 8 | Use ephemeral OS disks for stateless workloads | 100% of OS disk cost | Low | Low |
| 9 | Auto-pause dev SQL databases (Serverless tier) | 70-90% during idle | Low | Low |
| 10 | Use B-series for dev/test web servers | 15-55% vs D-series | Low | Medium |
| 11 | Right-size over-provisioned VMs (Azure Advisor) | 20-50% VM cost | Medium | Medium |
| 12 | Convert to Reserved Instances for stable workloads | 30-72% compute cost | Medium | Medium |
| 13 | Archive backups >90 days in Recovery Services Vault | 95% on old backups | Low | Medium |
| 14 | Filter Container Insights to error/warning only | 40-60% Log Analytics | Low | Medium |

## Case study: 2-tier web app optimization

**Baseline:** 12 VMs across prod/pre-prod/dev (D4_v5 Windows web + E8_v5 Linux DB),
all running 24/7. Monthly cost: ~5,071 EUR. Non-prod CPU utilization: 3-5%.

**Optimization waterfall (compute only):**

```
Current compute       3,747 EUR/mo
 - AHB               - 675  --> 3,073  (enable today, no downtime)
 - Start/Stop        -1,440 --> 1,633  (non-prod business hours only)
 - Rightsize Web     -  97  --> 1,536  (D4_v5 > B2ms for non-prod)
 - Rightsize DB      - 331  --> 1,205  (E8_v5 > E2_v5 for non-prod)
                               ------
Optimized compute     1,205 EUR/mo  (-67.9% compute reduction)
Annual savings       30,515 EUR/year
```

**Implementation order matters:**
1. **Week 1:** AHB - zero risk, zero downtime, immediate savings
2. **Week 1-2:** Start/Stop automation - low risk, high impact
3. **Week 3:** Rightsize non-prod web tier (stateless, easy rollback)
4. **Week 4-6:** Rightsize non-prod DB tier (stateful, validate carefully per VM)

**Key lesson:** 44% of Windows VM cost was license premium the company was double-paying.
AHB alone saved 675 EUR/month with a single CLI command per VM.

## EA-to-MCA transition - FinOps impact

Microsoft is actively migrating Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers to the Microsoft
Customer Agreement (MCA). While the transition is primarily a commercial restructuring,
it has significant FinOps operational consequences that teams must prepare for.

### What changes under MCA

| Dimension | EA | MCA |
|---|---|---|
| Billing hierarchy | Single enrollment, departments, accounts | Billing account, billing profiles, invoice sections |
| Invoice structure | Single consolidated invoice | Multiple invoices (one per billing profile) |
| Commitment flexibility | Annual upfront or monthly payments | Pay-as-you-go default, optional commitments |
| Cost Management data | Full historical visibility | Pre-migration data may not carry over |
| Power BI connector | Legacy EA connector | Deprecated - must use FOCUS exports + ADLS |
| FinOps Toolkit support | Direct EA integration | Requires migration to storage-based exports or FinOps Hubs |

### FinOps risks during transition

**Historical data visibility loss.** Cost Management may not display pre-migration
spending after the switch. Export historical data before migration begins. Without
this, year-over-year comparisons and trend analysis break.

**Power BI reporting disruption.** The legacy EA Power BI connector is deprecated
under MCA. Teams must migrate to FOCUS-aligned exports to Azure Data Lake Storage
(ADLS) and rebuild Power BI reports against the new schema. Plan for 2-4 weeks of
reporting rework.

**Savings plan and reservation visibility gaps.** Commitment discount usage reporting
changes under MCA billing scopes. Verify that existing reservation and savings plan
utilisation dashboards still function after migration. Re-scope alerts and reports
to the new billing profile hierarchy.

**Invoice reconciliation complexity.** Multiple billing profiles generate separate
invoices. Teams accustomed to a single EA invoice need new reconciliation processes.
Map cost centres and departments to MCA invoice sections before migration.

### Migration checklist for FinOps teams

- [ ] Export 12-24 months of historical cost data from Cost Management before migration
- [ ] Document current EA billing hierarchy and map to planned MCA structure
- [ ] Inventory all Power BI reports using the legacy EA connector
- [ ] Plan migration to FOCUS exports + ADLS (or FinOps Hubs) for reporting
- [ ] Verify reservation and savings plan visibility in the new billing scope
- [ ] Update cost allocation rules and management group assignments
- [ ] Test showback/chargeback reports against the new invoice structure
- [ ] Update Azure Policy assignments if scoped to EA enrollment or departments

### FinOps Toolkit migration paths

Microsoft's FinOps Toolkit supports two migration approaches:

1. **Storage-based exports** - configure Cost Management exports to ADLS Gen2 in
   FOCUS format, then connect Power BI directly. Simpler but requires manual schema
   management.

2. **FinOps Hubs** - deploy the FinOps Hubs solution for automated ingestion,
   normalisation, and multi-tenant support. Recommended for organisations with
   multiple billing profiles or complex allocation requirements.

Both approaches produce FOCUS-compliant data, which is the forward-looking standard
for Azure cost reporting.

---

### Compute Optimization Patterns (13)

**Underutilized Azure Reserved Instance Due To Workload Drift**
Service: Azure Reservations | Type: Commitment Misalignment

As workloads evolve, Azure Reserved Instances (RIs) may no longer align with actual usage  - due to refactoring, region changes, autoscaling, or instance-type drift. When this happens, the committed usage goes unused, while new workloads run on non-covered SKUs, resulting in both underutilized reservations and full-price on-demand charges elsewhere.

- Evaluate whether any existing workloads could be migrated to match the reservation scope
- For new workloads, consider provisioning on RI-covered instance types when technically viable
- Where appropriate, exchange the reservation for a more relevant SKU

**Oversized Hosting Plan For Azure Functions**
Service: Inefficiency Type | Type: Explanation

Teams often choose the Premium or App Service Plan for Azure Functions to avoid cold start delays or enable VNET connectivity, especially early in a project when performance concerns dominate. However, these decisions are rarely revisited -even as usage patterns change.

- Move low-usage or non-critical Function Apps to the Consumption Plan
- Pilot plan downgrades in non-production or latency-tolerant environments
- Use cost modeling tools to estimate savings from switching to Consumption Plan

**Missing Scheduled Shutdown For Non Production Azure Virtual Machines**
Service: Azure Virtual Machines | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Non-production Azure VMs are frequently left running during off-hours despite being used only during business hours. When these instances remain active overnight or on weekends, they generate unnecessary compute spend.

- Enable Azure’s built-in auto-shutdown setting for applicable non-prod VMs
- Alternatively, configure shutdown/start schedules using Azure Automation or Logic Apps
- Preserve state using managed disks, snapshots, or generalized images

**Orphaned And Overprovisioned Resources In Aks Clusters**
Service: Azure AKS | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Clusters often accumulate unused components when applications are terminated or environments are cloned. These include PVCs backed by Managed Disks, Services that still front Azure Load Balancers, and test namespaces that are no longer maintained.

- Delete unused PVCs to release backing Managed Disks
- Clean up Services that are no longer in use to avoid unnecessary load balancer charges
- Scale down underutilized node pools

**Orphaned Kubernetes Resources 230Dd**
Service: Azure AKS | Type: Orphaned Resource

Kubernetes environments often accumulate unused resources over time as applications evolve. Common examples include Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) backed by Azure Disks, Services that trigger load balancer provisioning, or stale ConfigMaps and Secrets.

- Before deletion, verify resources are truly orphaned
- Delete orphaned PVCs to release Azure Managed Disks
- Remove Services that no longer front active workloads to deallocate Load Balancers and public IPs

**Outdated Azure App Service Plan**
Service: Azure App Service | Type: Outdated Resource

Applications running on App Service V2 plans may incur higher operational costs and degraded performance compared to V3 plans. V2 uses older hardware generations that lack access to platform-level enhancements introduced in V3, including improved cold start times, faster scaling, and enhanced networking options.

- Evaluate workload compatibility with V3-based plans (e.g., Premium v3 or Isolated v2)
- Plan a phased migration of applications from V2 to V3 to improve performance and reduce cost per resource unit
- Update infrastructure-as-code templates and provisioning defaults to prefer V3-based plans

**Outdated Virtual Machine Version In Azure**
Service: Azure Virtual Machines | Type: Outdated Resource

Many organizations choose a VM SKU and version (e.g., `D4s_v3`) during the initial planning phase of a project, often based on availability, compatibility, or early cost estimates. Over time, Microsoft releases newer hardware generations (e.g., `D4s_v4`, `D4s_v5`) that offer equivalent or better performance at the same or reduced cost.

- Evaluate alternative VM versions (e.g., v4 or v5) within the same family to identify better cost/performance options
- Plan and schedule VM resizing during maintenance windows to avoid unplanned downtime
- Coordinate with application owners to validate compatibility and risk tolerance

**Underutilized Azure Virtual Machine**
Service: Azure Virtual Machines | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Azure VMs are frequently provisioned with more vCPU and memory than needed, often based on template defaults or peak demand assumptions. When a VM operates well below its capacity for an extended period, it presents an opportunity to reduce costs through rightsizing.

- Analyze average CPU and memory utilization of running VM’s to determine
- Review whether application requirements justify the current VM size
- Evaluate if the workload would perform similarly on a lower SKU within the same VM series

**Inefficient Use Of Photon Engine In Azure Databricks**
Service: Databricks | Type: Suboptimal Configuration

Photon is optimized for SQL workloads, delivering significant speedups through vectorized execution and native C++ performance. However, Photon only accelerates workloads that use compatible operations and data patterns.

- Ensure that Photon is only enabled for workloads structured to benefit from vectorized execution
- Refactor SQL logic and data models to align with Photon-optimized patterns (e.g., filter pushdowns, supported UDFs)
- Use built-in tools such as query plans and job profiles to verify Photon execution

**Missing Shared Scope Configuration For Azure Reservations**
Service: Azure Reservations | Type: Suboptimal Configuration

When reservations are scoped only to a single subscription, any unused capacity cannot be applied to matching resources in other subscriptions within the same tenant. This leads to underutilization of the committed reservation and continued on-demand charges in other parts of the organization.

- Change reservation scope from *Single* to *Shared* in the Azure Portal or via API
- Reevaluate periodically to ensure the scope aligns with current organizational structure and usage distribution

**Suboptimal Architecture Selection For Azure Virtual Machines**
Service: Azure Virtual Machines | Type: Suboptimal Pricing Model

Azure provides VM families across three major CPU architectures, but default provisioning often leans toward Intel-based SKUs due to inertia or pre-configured templates. AMD and ARM alternatives offer substantial cost savings; ARM in particular can be 30–50% cheaper for general-purpose workloads.

- Assess workload compatibility with ARM or AMD architectures
- Propose migration to ARM-based SKUs for supported workloads to reduce compute costs
- Use AMD-based instances as an intermediate option when ARM compatibility is not feasible

**Idle Azure App Service Plan Without Deployed Applications**
Service: Azure App Service | Type: Unused Resource

App Service Plans continue to incur charges even when no applications are deployed. This can occur when applications are deleted, migrated, or retired, but the associated App Service Plan remains active.

- Decommission App Service Plans with no active applications unless a future use case is explicitly confirmed
- In cases with low utilization, consider consolidating multiple lightly used plans into a single plan to reduce spend
- Establish governance practices to routinely identify and remove orphaned plans after application lifecycle events

**Inactive And Stopped Vm**
Service: Azure Virtual Machines | Type: Unused Resource

This inefficiency arises when a virtual machine is left in a stopped (deallocated) state for an extended period but continues to incur costs through attached storage and associated resources. These idle VMs are often remnants of retired workloads, temporary environments, or paused projects that were never fully cleaned up.

- Identify virtual machines that have remained in a stopped (deallocated) state for the entire lookback period
- Review whether any activity has occurred from the associated managed disks, network interfaces, or backup processes
- Evaluate whether the VM is part of a dev/test or legacy environment with no recent usage

### Storage Optimization Patterns (16)

**Archival Blob Container Storing Objects In Non Archival Tiers**
Service: Azure Blob Storage | Type: Inefficient Configuration

This inefficiency occurs when a blob container intended for long-term or infrequently accessed data continues to store objects in higher-cost tiers like Hot or Cool, instead of using the Archive tier. This often happens when containers are created without lifecycle policies or default tier settings.

- Identify blob containers with large volumes of data stored in the Hot or Cool tier
- Evaluate access patterns to confirm whether the data is rarely or never read
- Review whether the container’s data retention requirements align with archival use cases

**High Transaction Cost Due To Misaligned Tier In Azure Blob Storage**
Service: Azure Blob Storage | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Azure Blob Storage tiers are designed to optimize cost based on access frequency. However, when frequently accessed data is stored in the Cool or Archive tiers -either due to misconfiguration, default settings, or cost-only optimization -transaction costs can spike.

- Move frequently accessed data to the Hot tier, either manually or via lifecycle management policies
- Evaluate default tiering settings on upload processes to prevent misplacement of active data
- Incorporate access pattern analysis into storage tier selection decisions

**High Transaction Cost Due To Misaligned Tier In Azure Files**
Service: Azure Files | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Azure Files Standard tier is cost-effective for low-traffic scenarios but imposes per-operation charges that grow rapidly with frequent access. In contrast, Premium tier provides consistent IOPS and throughput without additional transaction charges.

- Evaluate cost-performance tradeoffs between Standard and Premium tiers
- If justified, migrate data to a new Azure Files Premium account (required for tier change)
- Use performance metrics and transaction volume to guide future provisioning decisions

**Inactive Blobs In Storage Account**
Service: Azure Blob Storage | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Storage accounts can accumulate blob data that is no longer actively accessed -such as legacy logs, expired backups, outdated exports, or orphaned files. When these blobs remain in the Hot tier, they continue to incur the highest storage cost, even if they have not been read or modified for an extended period.

- Identify storage accounts with large amounts of data in the Hot tier
- Analyze blob-level access patterns using logs or metrics to confirm that data has not been read or written over a defined lookback period
- Determine whether the data is still relevant to any active workload, process, or compliance requirement

**Sftp Feature Enabled On Azure Storage Account Without Usage**
Service: Azure Storage Account | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Azure users may enable the SFTP feature on Storage Accounts during migration tests, integration scenarios, or experimentation. However, if left enabled after initial use, the feature continues to generate flat hourly charges  - even when no SFTP traffic occurs.

- Disable the SFTP feature on any Storage Account where it is no longer needed
- Coordinate with owners to confirm that alternate access methods (e.g., HTTPS, SDK) are sufficient
- Consider including SFTP enablement in governance reviews to catch idle services before they accumulate charges

**Missing Performance Plus On Eligible Managed Disks**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Misconfiguration

For Premium SSD and Standard SSD disks 513 GiB or larger, Azure now offers the option to enable Performance Plus  - unlocking higher IOPS and MBps at no extra cost. Many environments that previously required custom performance settings continue to pay for additional throughput unnecessarily.

- Enable Performance Plus on all eligible disks using Azure CLI, API, or portal
- Decommission paid performance tiers or custom throughput settings where Performance Plus provides equivalent capability
- Incorporate Performance Plus enablement into provisioning templates for large disks going forward

**Outdated And Expensive Premium Ssd Disk**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Modernization

Workloads using legacy Premium SSD managed disks may be eligible for migration to Premium SSD v2, which delivers equivalent or improved performance characteristics at a lower cost. Premium SSD v2 decouples disk size from performance metrics like IOPS and throughput, enabling more granular cost optimization.

- Identify Premium SSD managed disks provisioned using the original Premium SSD offering (not v2)
- Review disk IOPS, throughput, and sizing requirements to ensure compatibility with Premium SSD v2 capabilities
- Analyze whether the current SKU size (e.g., P30, P40) exceeds actual capacity and performance needs

**Outdated And Expensive Standard Ssd Disk**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Modernization

Standard SSD disks can often be replaced with Premium SSD v2 disks, offering enhanced IOPS, throughput, and durability at competitive or lower pricing. For workloads that require moderate to high performance but are currently constrained by Standard SSD capabilities, migrating to Premium SSD v2 improves both performance and cost efficiency without significant operational overhead.

- Identify Managed Disks using the Standard SSD offering that are eligible for migration to Premium SSD v2
- Review workload performance requirements to confirm suitability for Premium SSD v2 characteristics
- Verify regional availability of Premium SSD v2 before planning migration

**Excessive Retention Of Audit Logs**
Service: Azure Blob Storage | Type: Over-Retention of Data

Audit logs are often retained longer than necessary, especially in environments where the logging destination is not carefully selected. Projects that initially route SQL Audit Logs or other high-volume sources to LAW or Azure Storage may forget to revisit their retention strategy.

- Azure Storage Lifecycle Management Overview

**Overprovisioned Managed Disk For Vm Limits**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Each Azure VM size has a defined limit for total disk IOPS and throughput. When high-performance disks (e.g., Premium SSDs with high IOPS capacity) are attached to low-tier VMs, the disk’s performance capabilities may exceed what the VM can consume.

- Resize disks to match the performance envelope of the associated VM
- Downgrade to lower disk tiers (e.g., Premium SSD → Standard SSD) when full performance is not needed
- Establish guardrails to ensure disk and VM configurations are aligned during provisioning and resizing events

**Long Retained Azure Snapshot**
Service: Azure Snapshots | Type: Retained Unused Resource

Snapshots are often created for short-term protection before changes to a VM or disk, but many remain in the environment far beyond their intended lifespan. Over time, this leads to an accumulation of snapshots that are no longer associated with any active resource or retained for operational need.Since Azure does not enforce automatic expiration or lifecycle policies for snapshots, they can persist indefinitely and continue to incur monthly storage charges.

- Manually review long-retained snapshots with application or infrastructure owners
- Delete snapshots no longer needed for recovery, rollback, or compliance retention
- Adopt tagging standards to track purpose, owner, and expected retention period at time of snapshot creation

**Inactive And Detached Managed Disk**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Unused Resource

Managed Disks frequently remain detached after Azure virtual machines are deleted, reimaged, or reconfigured. Some may be intentionally retained for reattachment, backup, or migration purposes, but many persist unintentionally due to the lack of automated cleanup processes.

- Identify Managed Disks that are in an unattached state (not linked to any VM)
- Review metrics or activity logs to determine whether the disk has seen any read or write operations during the lookback period
- Check whether the disk is intentionally retained for recovery, migration, or reattachment

**Inactive Files In Storage Account**
Service: Azure Blob Storage | Type: Unused Resource

Files that show no read or write activity over an extended period often indicate redundant or abandoned data. Keeping inactive files in higher-cost storage classes unnecessarily increases monthly spend.

- Identify storage accounts or containers containing blobs with no reads or modifications over a defined lookback period
- Analyze blob access logs and object metadata to validate inactivity
- Review creation timestamps, tags, and business ownership metadata to assess ongoing relevance

**Inactive Tables In Storage Account**
Service: Azure Table Storage | Type: Unused Resource

Tables with no read or write activity often represent deprecated applications, obsolete telemetry, or abandoned development artifacts. Retaining inactive tables increases storage costs and operational complexity.

- Identify Azure Table Storage tables with no read or write operations over a defined lookback period
- Review table creation dates, metadata, and ownership tags to assess relevance and intended retention
- Check for compliance, legal hold, or audit requirements before initiating deletions or exports

**Managed Disk Attached To A Deallocated Vm**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Unused Resource

This inefficiency occurs when a VM is deallocated but its attached managed disks are still active and incurring storage charges. While compute billing stops for deallocated VMs, the disks remain provisioned and billable.

- Identify managed disks attached to deallocated VMs during the defined lookback period
- Review disk activity to confirm no read/write operations occurred while the VM was deallocated
- Evaluate whether the disk is still needed for backup, migration, or future reactivation

**Managed Disk Attached To A Stopped Vm**
Service: Azure Managed Disks | Type: Unused Resource

Disks attached to VMs that have been stopped for an extended period, particularly when showing no read or write activity, may indicate abandoned infrastructure or obsolete resources. Retaining these disks without validation leads to unnecessary monthly storage costs.

- Identify Managed Disks attached to virtual machines that have remained in a stopped state over a representative time window
- Analyze disk activity metrics to detect absence of read/write operations during the lookback period
- Review VM metadata, ownership tags, and decommissioning records to assess whether the disk is still required

### Databases Optimization Patterns (8)

**Business Critical Tier On Non Production Sql Instance**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Non-production environments such as development, testing, or staging often do not require the high availability, failover capabilities, and premium storage performance offered by the Business Critical tier. Running these workloads on Business Critical unnecessarily inflates costs.

- Migrate non-production SQL instances from the Business Critical tier to a lower-cost alternative, such as General Purpose.
- Use downtime windows or database copy strategies to minimize risk during tier transitions, depending on instance size and availability requirements.
- Monitor performance after migration to ensure the workload remains stable and meets operational needs.

**Unnecessary Use Of Ra Grs For Azure Sql Backup Storage**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Azure SQL databases often use the default backup configuration, which stores backups in RA-GRS storage to ensure geo-redundancy. While suitable for high-availability production systems, this level of resilience may be unnecessary for development, testing, or lower-impact workloads.

- For non-critical or non-regulated workloads, change the backup redundancy setting to LRS (or ZRS where supported)
- Document any exceptions where RA-GRS must be retained for compliance
- Incorporate backup configuration reviews into provisioning and governance processes

**Infrequently Accessed Data Stored In Azure Cosmos Db**
Service: Azure Cosmos DB | Type: Inefficient Storage Tiering

Azure Cosmos DB is optimized for low-latency, globally distributed workloads -not long-term storage of infrequently accessed data. Yet in many environments, cold data such as logs, telemetry, or historical records is retained in Cosmos DB due to a lack of lifecycle management.

- Export infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage services:
- Use Blob Storage Cool for rarely accessed but readily retrievable data
- Use Blob Storage Archive for long-term retention with delayed retrieval

**Overprovisioned Azure Database For Postgresql Flexible Server**
Service: Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible Server | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible Server often defaults to general-purpose D-series VMs, which may be oversized for many production or development workloads. PostgreSQL typically does not require a high sustained high CPU, making it well-suited to memory-optimized (E-series) or burstable (B-series) instances.

- Resize the PostgreSQL Flexible Server to a smaller or more suitable VM family based on actual workload behavior
- For low-CPU workloads, consider B-series (burstable) or E-series (memory-optimized) configurations
- Review usage patterns quarterly to ensure the selected SKU remains aligned with performance needs

**Overprovisioned Compute Tier In Azure Sql Database**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Azure SQL Database resources are frequently overprovisioned due to default configurations, conservative sizing, or legacy requirements that no longer apply. This inefficiency appears across all deployment models: * Single Databases may be assigned more DTUs or vCores than the workload requires * Elastic Pools may be oversized for the actual demand of pooled databases * Managed Instances are often deployed with excess compute capacity that remains underutilized Because billing is based on provisioned capacity, not actual consumption, organizations incur unnecessary costs when sizing is not aligned with workload behavior.

- Downsize the compute tier (DTUs or vCores) to better match observed usage
- For Elastic Pools, reduce the total eDTUs/vCores and consider consolidating lightly used databases
- For Managed Instances, assess whether the vCore allocation can be reduced or workloads refactored

**Overprovisioned Storage In Azure Sql Elastic Pools Or Managed Instances**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Azure SQL deployments often reserve more storage than needed, either due to default provisioning settings or anticipated future growth. Over time, if actual usage remains low, these oversized allocations generate unnecessary storage costs.

- Where supported, reduce provisioned storage to better align with actual usage
- For Managed Instances, safely execute `DBCC SHRINKFILE` or equivalent operations before resizing
- Incorporate storage reviews into regular database hygiene practices

**Overbilling Due To Tier Switches And Allocation Overlaps In Dtu Model**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Suboptimal Pricing Model

Workloads that frequently scale up and down within the same day -whether manually, via automation, or platform-managed -can encounter hidden cost amplification under the DTU model. When a database changes tiers (e.g., S7 → S4), Azure treats each tiered segment as a separate allocation and applies full-hour rounding independently.

- Minimize same-day tier switches unless operationally justified
- Schedule up/down-scaling during off-peak windows to reduce risk of overlapping billing
- Move to the vCore or serverless pricing model for more transparent and granular cost control

**Idle Azure Sql Elastic Pool Without Databases**
Service: Azure SQL | Type: Unused Resource

An Azure SQL Elastic Pool continues to incur costs even if it contains no databases. This can occur when databases are deleted, migrated to single-instance configurations, or consolidated elsewhere  - but the pool itself remains provisioned.

- Decommission any Elastic Pool with no active databases unless a valid business case exists for retaining it
- Review infrastructure-as-code templates and automation pipelines to ensure pool cleanup is included in deprovisioning workflows
- Establish periodic audits to catch and remove idle pools across subscriptions and teams

### Networking Optimization Patterns (5)

**Suboptimal Load Balancer Rule Configuration In Azure Standard Load Balancer**
Service: Azure Load Balancer | Type: Inefficient Configuration

As organizations migrate from the Basic to the Standard tier of Azure Load Balancer (driven by Microsoft’s retirement of the Basic tier), they may unknowingly inherit cost structures they didn’t previously face. Specifically, each load balancing rule -both inbound and outbound -can contribute to ongoing charges.

- Audit existing Standard Load Balancer rule sets to identify unused entries
- Remove unnecessary inbound and outbound rules, especially in non-production environments
- Avoid blanket rule creation in templated environments unless explicitly required

**Inactive Azure Load Balancer**
Service: Azure Load Balancer | Type: Unused Resource

In dynamic environments  - especially during autoscaling, testing, or infrastructure changes  - it's common for load balancers to remain provisioned after their backend resources have been decommissioned. When this happens, the load balancer continues to incur hourly charges despite serving no functional purpose.

- Delete Azure Load Balancers that have no backend pool members and no observed traffic
- Implement automation or tagging policies to detect and flag inactive networking resources
- Update infrastructure-as-code or deployment scripts to ensure load balancers are removed alongside their dependent compute resources

**Inactive Azure Load Balancer 0Fe41**
Service: Azure Load Balancer | Type: Unused Resource

Standard Load Balancers are frequently provisioned for internal services, internet-facing applications, or testing environments. When a workload is decommissioned or moved, the load balancer may be left behind without any active backend pool or traffic  - but continues to incur hourly charges for each frontend IP configuration.Because Azure does not automatically remove or alert on inactive load balancers, and because they may not show significant outbound traffic, these resources often persist unnoticed.

- Delete load balancers that have no active backend pool and are no longer needed
- Review associated resources (e.g., front-end IP configurations, probes, rules) to ensure they can be safely removed
- Establish tagging or documentation standards to track ownership and intended usage

**Inactive Web Application Firewall Waf**
Service: Azure WAF | Type: Unused Resource

Azure WAF configurations attached to Application Gateways can persist after their backend pool resources have been removed  - often during environment reconfiguration or application decommissioning. In these cases, the WAF is no longer serving any functional purpose but continues to incur fixed hourly costs.

- Delete WAF configurations that are no longer routing traffic or protecting active applications
- Establish periodic audits to flag and review WAFs with empty backend pools
- Use automated checks to detect and alert on WAF deployments with no active use

**Unassigned Public Ip Address**
Service: AWS VPC | Type: Unused Resource

In Azure, it’s common for public IP addresses to be created as part of virtual machine or load balancer configurations. When those resources are deleted or reconfigured, the IP address may remain in the environment unassigned.

- Delete unassigned Standard SKU public IPs that are no longer needed
- If an unassigned IP is intended for future use, consider converting it to Basic (if compatible)
- Incorporate IP resource cleanup into deprovisioning workflows

### Other Optimization Patterns (6)

**Transactable Vs Non Transactable Confusion In Azure Marketplace**
Service: Azure Marketplace | Type: Commitment Misalignment

Azure Marketplace offers two types of listings: transactable and non-transactable. Only transactable purchases contribute toward a customer’s MACC commitment. See the "Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)" section under Commitment discounts for full drawdown mechanics, including what counts and what does not.

- Prefer transactable listings in Azure Marketplace whenever MACC utilization is a priority
- Validate SKU eligibility against Microsoft’s Procurement Playbook or MACC eligibility lists
- Standardize sourcing templates and procurement workflows to explicitly document whether the offer contributes to MACC
- Confirm that the purchase is transacted through the Azure portal under a subscription tied to the enrollment - credit card purchases on the Marketplace website do not count toward MACC even for eligible products

**Lifecycle Visibility Gaps Inflating Renewal Costs In Azure Marketplace**
Service: Azure Marketplace | Type: Contract Lifecycle Mismanagement

When Marketplace contracts or subscriptions expire or change without visibility, Azure may automatically continue billing at higher on-demand or list prices. These lapses often go unnoticed due to lack of proactive tracking, ownership, or renewal alerts, resulting in substantial cost increases.

- Assign clear ownership of Marketplace contracts across business, finance, or procurement teams
- Set calendar-based and system-based reminders for contract renewals and entitlement expiration
- Regularly reconcile Azure billing data with vendor-provided SLA or entitlement terms

**Inefficient Use Of Azure Pipelines**
Service: Inefficiency Type | Type: Explanation

Teams often overuse Microsoft-hosted agents by running redundant or low-value jobs, failing to configure pipelines efficiently, or neglecting to use self-hosted agents for steady workloads. These inefficiencies result in unnecessary cost and delivery friction, especially when pipelines create queues due to limited agent availability.

- Audit and streamline pipelines to remove redundant or unnecessary stages
- Use conditional logic to limit execution of non-critical pipelines
- Prioritize agent capacity for pipelines supporting core or production workloads

**Overly Frequent Querying In Azure Monitor Alerts**
Service: Inefficiency Type | Type: Inefficient Configuration

While high-frequency alerting is sometimes justified for production SLAs, it's often overused across non-critical alerts or replicated blindly across environments. Projects with multiple environments (e.g., dev, QA, staging, prod) often duplicate alert rules without adjusting for business impact, which can lead to alert sprawl and inflated monitoring costs.

- Test changes gradually. Start with non-production environments and non-critical alerts

**Inefficient Private Link Routing To Azure Databricks**
Service: Azure Databricks | Type: Misconfiguration

In Azure Databricks environments that rely on Private Link for secure networking, it’s common to route traffic through multi-tiered network architectures. This often includes multiple VNets, Private Link endpoints, or peered subscriptions between data sources (e.g., ADLS) and the Databricks compute plane.

- Simplify routing by colocating Databricks and storage in the same region and VNet when possible
- Eliminate redundant Private Link endpoints that add no security or compliance value
- Use direct peering or shared services models to reduce network traversal

**Suboptimal Table Plan Selection In Log Analytics**
Service: Inefficiency Type | Type: Suboptimal Pricing Model

By default, all Log Analytics tables are created under the Analytics plan, which is optimized for high-performance querying and interactive analysis. However, not all telemetry requires real-time access or frequent querying.

- Assign the Basic plan to tables that are retained for audit, archival, or compliance purposes
- Split high-volume ingestion sources into separate tables based on access needs
- Reconfigure ingestion routes to direct non-essential logs to lower-cost tables
