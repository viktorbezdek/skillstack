# Command Template - OpenCode Slash Commands

Templates and best practices for creating production-quality slash commands in OpenCode.

> **STYLE STANDARD:** Commands use numbered ALL-CAPS section headers with emoji prefix. Format: `## N. [EMOJI] SECTION-NAME`. See Section 8 Validation Checklist for details.

---

## 1. 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

### Frontmatter Requirements

| Field | Required | Purpose | Format |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| `description` | Yes | Human-readable purpose | One sentence, action-verb start |
| `argument-hint` | Recommended | Show expected arguments | `<required> [optional] [--flag]` |
| `allowed-tools` | Recommended | Tools command can use | Comma-separated list |
| `name` | No | Override command name | kebab-case (inferred from filename) |
| `model` | No | Override default model (use sparingly) | `opus` for complex reasoning only |

> **Note on `model` field**: Only use for commands requiring complex reasoning (e.g., complex multi-step workflows that benefit from `opus`). Most commands should NOT specify a model and use the default.

### Command Types

| Type | Complexity | Template |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Simple** | Single action, few args | Section 3 |
| **Workflow** | Multi-step process | Section 4 |
| **Mode-Based** | `:auto`/`:confirm` variants | Section 5 |
| **Argument Dispatch** | Multiple entry points/actions | Section 6 |
| **Destructive** | Requires confirmation | Section 7 |
| **Namespace** | Grouped commands (`/group:action`) | Section 8 |

---

## 2. 🚨 MANDATORY GATE PATTERN (CRITICAL)

**For commands with REQUIRED arguments**, add a mandatory gate immediately after frontmatter to prevent context inference.

### Why This Pattern Exists

Without this gate, AI agents may:
- Infer tasks from conversation history or open files
- Assume what the user wants based on screenshots or context
- Proceed with incorrect assumptions instead of asking

### The Pattern

Add this block **immediately after frontmatter, before any other content**:

```markdown
# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

**BEFORE READING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE, CHECK `$ARGUMENTS`:**

\`\`\`
IF $ARGUMENTS is empty, undefined, or contains only whitespace (ignoring mode flags):
    → STOP IMMEDIATELY
    → Present the user with this question:
        question: "[Context-appropriate question]"
        options:
          - label: "[Action label]"
            description: "[What user will provide]"
    → WAIT for user response
    → Use their response as the [input type]
    → Only THEN continue with this workflow

IF $ARGUMENTS contains [expected input]:
    → Continue reading this file
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **DO NOT** infer [input type] from context, screenshots, or existing files
- **DO NOT** assume what the user wants based on conversation history
- **DO NOT** proceed past this point without an explicit [input] from the user
- The [input] MUST come from `$ARGUMENTS` or user's answer to the question above
```

### When to Use

| Argument Type | Use Mandatory Gate? | Example |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| `<required>` (angle brackets) | **YES** | `<task>`, `<query>`, `<spec-folder>` |
| `[optional]` (square brackets) | No (has default) | `[count]`, `[--flag]` |
| `[:auto\|:confirm]` mode flags | No (mode selection) | Mode suffixes only |

### Example Questions by Command Type

| Command Purpose | Question |
|-----------------|----------|
| Planning | "What would you like to plan?" |
| Research | "What topic would you like to research?" |
| Implementation | "Which spec folder would you like to implement?" |
| File improvement | "What would you like to improve and which files?" |
| Prompt enhancement | "What prompt would you like to improve?" |
| Generic routing | "What request would you like to route?" |

---

## 5. 🔀 MODE-BASED COMMAND TEMPLATE

Use for: Commands supporting `:auto` and `:confirm` execution modes.

```markdown
---
description: [Workflow name] ([N] steps) - [purpose]. Supports :auto and :confirm modes
argument-hint: "<request> [:auto|:confirm]"
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Task
---

# 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO NOT SKIP

[Include mandatory gate pattern from Section 2]

---

# [Command Title]

**Purpose**: [Description of what this command accomplishes.]

---

## 1. 📋 USER INPUT

\`\`\`text
$ARGUMENTS
\`\`\`

---

## 2. 🔍 MODE DETECTION & ROUTING

### Step 1: Parse Mode Suffix

Detect execution mode from command invocation:

| Pattern | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/command:auto` | AUTONOMOUS | Execute all steps without user approval gates |
| `/command:confirm` | INTERACTIVE | Pause at each step for user approval |
| `/command` (no suffix) | PROMPT | Ask user to choose mode |

### Step 2: Mode Selection (when no suffix detected)

If no `:auto` or `:confirm` suffix is present, present options to user:

**Question**: "How would you like to execute this workflow?"

| Option | Mode | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **A** | Autonomous | Execute all steps without approval gates. Best for [use case]. |
| **B** | Interactive | Pause at each step for approval. Best for [use case]. |

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Transform Raw Input

Parse the raw text from `$ARGUMENTS` and transform into structured fields.

---

## 3. ⚡ KEY BEHAVIORS

### Autonomous Mode (`:auto`)
- Executes all steps without user approval gates
- Self-validates at each checkpoint
- Makes informed decisions based on best judgment
- Documents all significant decisions

### Interactive Mode (`:confirm`)
- Pauses after each step for user approval
- Presents options: Approve, Review Details, Modify, Skip, Abort
- Documents user decisions at each checkpoint
- Allows course correction throughout workflow

---

## 4. 📁 CONTEXT LOADING

When resuming work in an existing spec folder, prompt to load prior session memory:
- **A)** Load most recent memory file (quick context refresh)
- **B)** Load all recent files (up to 3) (comprehensive context)
- **C)** List all files and select specific (historical search)
- **D)** Skip (start fresh, no context)

---

## 5. 🎯 EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Autonomous execution**
\`\`\`
/command:auto [arguments]
\`\`\`

**Example 2: Interactive execution**
\`\`\`
/command:confirm [arguments]
\`\`\`

**Example 3: Prompt for mode selection**
\`\`\`
/command [arguments]
\`\`\`
```

---

## 6. 🧭 ARGUMENT DISPATCH PATTERN

Use for: Commands that accept multiple argument types and need to route to different actions.

### Pattern Overview

When a single command handles multiple argument patterns (like `/semantic_search` accepting queries, actions, and flags), use an ASCII decision tree to document the routing logic clearly.

### The Pattern

```markdown
---
description: [Command] with multiple entry points
argument-hint: "[action|query] [options]"
allowed-tools: [Tools]
---

# [Command Title]

---

## 1. 📋 ARGUMENT DISPATCH

```
$ARGUMENTS
    │
    ├─► Empty (no args)
    │   └─► DEFAULT ACTION: [What happens with no args]
    │
    ├─► First word matches ACTION KEYWORD (case-insensitive)
    │   ├─► "start" | "on" | "init"       → START ACTION
    │   ├─► "stop" | "off" | "kill"       → STOP ACTION
    │   ├─► "status" | "info"             → STATUS ACTION
    │   ├─► "search" | "find" | "query"   → SEARCH ACTION (remaining args = query)
    │   └─► "reset" | "clear"             → RESET ACTION
    │
    ├─► Looks like NATURAL LANGUAGE QUERY
    │   Detection: 2+ words, question words, code terms, quotes
    │   └─► SEARCH ACTION (full args = query)
    │
    └─► Single ambiguous word
        └─► [DEFAULT ACTION] (assume most common intent)
```

---

## 2. ⚡ ACTION HANDLERS

### START ACTION
[Instructions for start]

### STOP ACTION
[Instructions for stop]

### SEARCH ACTION
[Instructions for search]

---

## 3. 📊 EXAMPLE ROUTING

| Input | Detected As | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| (empty) | No args | Show menu/help |
| `start` | Keyword | START ACTION |
| `how does auth work` | Natural language | SEARCH ACTION |
| `oauth` | Single word | SEARCH ACTION (default) |
```

### When to Use Argument Dispatch

| Scenario | Use Pattern? |
|----------|--------------|
| Command has multiple action keywords | **Yes** |
| Command accepts both keywords AND queries | **Yes** |
| Command has only one action | No (use simple template) |
| Command uses `:auto`/`:confirm` modes only | No (use mode-based template) |

### Real Example: `/semantic_search`

```
/semantic_search [args]
    │
    ├─► No args
    │   └─► Show usage help
    │
    ├─► "index" | "reindex" | "rebuild"
    │   └─► INDEX ACTION: Rebuild vector index
    │
    ├─► "status" | "health"
    │   └─► STATUS ACTION: Show index health
    │
    ├─► Natural language query (2+ words)
    │   └─► SEARCH ACTION: Execute semantic search
    │
    └─► Single ambiguous word
        └─► SEARCH ACTION (assume search intent)
```

### Combining with Mode-Based Pattern

For commands that need BOTH argument dispatch AND mode support:

```
$ARGUMENTS
    │
    ├─► Parse mode suffix (:auto | :confirm)
    │
    └─► After mode extraction, dispatch remaining args:
        ├─► "action1" → ACTION 1
        ├─► "action2" → ACTION 2
        └─► Natural language → DEFAULT ACTION
```

---

## 8. ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE COMMAND TEMPLATE

Use for: Commands that delete data or make irreversible changes.

```markdown
---
description: [Action] (DESTRUCTIVE)
argument-hint: "[--confirm]"
allowed-tools: Bash
---

# [Command Title]

**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION** - [Brief warning about what will be affected.]

---

## 1. 📋 PURPOSE

[Explain the destructive action and why it might be needed.]

---

## 2. 📝 CONTRACT

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` — Must include `--confirm` flag to skip prompt
**Outputs:** `STATUS=<OK|FAIL|CANCELLED> ACTION=<action|cancelled>`

---

## 3. ⚡ INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Safety Check - Require Confirmation

- Check if `--confirm` flag is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If NOT present:
  - Ask user: "[Warning message]. Are you sure?"
  - Options: "Yes, proceed" / "No, cancel"
  - If user cancels: `STATUS=CANCELLED ACTION=cancelled`

### Step 2: Show What Will Be Affected

- Display current state
- List items that will be deleted/changed
- Show size/count of affected data

### Step 3: Execute Destructive Action

- [Step-by-step execution]
- Log each action taken

### Step 4: Verify Completion

- Confirm action completed
- Show new state

### Step 5: Provide Recovery Guidance

- Explain how to rebuild/restore if needed
- Link to relevant commands

### Step 6: Return Status

- If completed: `STATUS=OK ACTION=[action]`
- If cancelled: `STATUS=CANCELLED ACTION=cancelled`
- If failed: `STATUS=FAIL ERROR="<message>"`

---

## 4. 🔍 EXAMPLE USAGE

### Without Confirmation (Safe Default)

\`\`\`bash
/command-name
\`\`\`
→ Will prompt for confirmation before proceeding

### With Confirmation Flag (Skip Prompt)

\`\`\`bash
/command-name --confirm
\`\`\`
→ Proceeds immediately (use with caution)

---

## 5. 📌 NOTES

- **When to Use:**
  - [Valid use case 1]
  - [Valid use case 2]

- **Impact:**
  - [What will be lost]
  - [Other consequences]
  - [What is preserved]
  - [Recovery options]

- **Alternatives to Consider:**
  - [Less destructive alternative]
  - [Another option]

---

## 6. 🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES

- Requires explicit confirmation by default
- Shows what will be affected before proceeding
- Provides clear recovery steps
- Cannot accidentally affect [protected items]
```

---

## 9. 📁 NAMESPACE COMMAND PATTERN

Use for: Grouping related commands under a common prefix.

### Directory Structure

```
.opencode/command/
└── [namespace]/           # Directory name = namespace
    ├── [action1].md       # → /namespace:action1
    ├── [action2].md       # → /namespace:action2
    └── [action3].md       # → /namespace:action3
```

### Example: Index Namespace

```
.opencode/command/
└── index/
    ├── start.md     → /index:start
    ├── stop.md      → /index:stop
    ├── search.md    → /index:search
    ├── stats.md     → /index:stats
    ├── history.md   → /index:history
    └── reset.md     → /index:reset
```

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Namespace directory | lowercase, hyphen-case | `index/`, `git-workflow/` |
| Action files | lowercase, hyphen-case | `search.md`, `full-reset.md` |
| Resulting command | namespace:action | `/index:search` |
